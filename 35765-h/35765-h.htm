<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>It matters but little to the average reader
whether a book be wholly historical or purely imaginary
if it be of sufficient interest to hold the attention
in a pleasurable excitement to its close.</p>

<p>There are those however, who will be glad to
know that the following work was wrought out of
historical facts gleaned from a large parcel of letters
written by a son while a soldier in the army
of the rebellion, to his widowed mother, then in
Springfield, Mass.</p>

<p>Graphic were his descriptions of scenes and incidents
coming to his personal knowledge during
that memorable march from "Atlanta to the sea."</p>

<p>These I have woven into a web of fiction mingling
their lights and shadows, blending them as
best I could amid denser shades, hoping that peradventure
their coming to you, gentle reader, may
prove as great a pleasure in the perusing as the
author has enjoyed in the weaving.</p>

<h2>EDITOR'S PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="decor" />

<p>My editing of this most interesting story has been little
more than proof-correction. On reading the manuscript in
advance of the type-setting I soon found it safer to
leave the author's style to take care of itself, sure that it
will strike the public, as it struck me, with renewed respect
and admiration for one who, sightless, can excel so many
of us having all the senses.</p>

<p>It is touching to observe how the blind narrator dwells
on outward things,&mdash;color, light and shade, sunset skies,
human features and expressions,&mdash;which must come to her
only in imagination. She seems to dwell with peculiar
intensity on a world of beauty which we others, sated by
abundance, pass by unrecorded if not unnoticed.</p>

<p>Sightless she is not, for in her the mind's eye is of a
brilliancy that seems to make our mere physical vision useless
by comparison. Better the soul's sight without eyes,
than the eyesight without soul.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3><a name="MIDNIGHT_AT_CLIFF_HOUSE" id="MIDNIGHT_AT_CLIFF_HOUSE"></a>MIDNIGHT AT "CLIFF HOUSE."</h3>


<p>It was a dismal night out upon the ocean
where the huge billows tossed high their foaming
crests, or dashed with maddening fury upon the
rocky shore as if unwilling longer to submit to the
powers that shut them in; while ever and anon the
deep-mouthed thunder answered back through
the darkness "thus far shalt thou go, and no
farther."</p>

<p>Then ran the echoes along the shore and up
the ragged cliff on whose summit one feeble ray of
light struggled through the narrow crevice of a
curtained window out into the midnight gloom.
The howling winds made sad music through the
long corridors and curious wrought lattice work
that partially enclosed it; slamming the heavy
iron gate that had broken loose from its fastenings
and kept swaying to and fro upon its rusty hinges,
wakening by its unusual noise the huge watch dog
in his kennel, who growled menacingly at being
disturbed at such a late hour. The rain beat
furiously against the windows and ran in rapid cascades
down the steep declivity into the sea, falling
on the sandy shore that extended along the beach
at the foot of the cliff.</p>

<p>It was October, and the cottage on the summit
was usually deserted before this time, for the invalid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
who had resided there during five successive
seasons could not well endure the autumn breezes
when the frost-king had chilled them.</p>

<p>To-night, however, a tall, richly-dressed lady sat
alone in the spacious parlor, her black gown lying
in heavy folds on the white matting that covered
the floor, her head drooping wearily upon her hand
as her elbow rested on the table where the wasting
candle flickered low in the socket; but she heeded
it not. Now and then she would raise her head
with a sudden start and look intently at the door
opposite and then sink back again into the same
posture as before.</p>

<p>There was sadness upon her face, such as awakens
the deepest sympathy of a human heart; but
in the keen, glistening eye there was a deeper,
sterner look that would send a sister's tenderest
love back to its secret chamber, chilled and trembling!</p>

<p>There are hours made so big with actions and
resolves that <i>years</i> full of circumstances and results
are made to hang their heavy weights upon them.
Such an one was now passing, bearing away on its
dark wings the fearful impress made by a silent
finger, yet in characters that in after years will
reflect back upon the soul, filling it with horror and
dismay! A loud peal of thunder echoed through
the apartment and then rolled away in the distance,
leaving behind the mingled voices of the
winds and waves, with the fast falling rain on the
roof above.</p>

<p>The door suddenly opened and a servant girl
stealthily entered with a newly lighted candle,
placed it on the table exchanging it for the one
almost spent, and then as stealthily retired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The lady did not seem to notice the intruder, as
she did not enter the door where her expectant
eyes had so often turned with a wild, weird look,
and she remained as motionless as before.</p>

<p>Two o'clock. The little silvery bell on the mantel
proclaimed the hour, and the tall bent figure at
the table gave a sudden start, as though a new
pang had penetrated her sensitive brain.</p>

<p>A few moments after, the door toward which her
eyes had so often wandered slowly opened and a
little girl scarcely ten years of age, timidly entered
and approached the lady.</p>

<p>"Mother would like to come in," she said, with
a faltering voice, while her pale blue eyes were
fixed on the matting at her feet.</p>

<p>"Tell her to come," was the laconic reply, and
the child hurried away with a much quicker step
than that with which she had entered.</p>

<p>Immediately a small, nervous little woman
appeared, with a cold, rigid, sallow face, small gray
eyes and sandy hair, bearing in her arms a bundle
of soft white flannel, which she pressed mechanically
to her well-rounded bust, and without any
salutation seated herself upon a wicker chair, and
with the utmost <i>sang froid</i> commenced unrolling
the white flannel she had laid upon her lap.</p>

<p>"It's a wee darling," she said, after a lengthy
pause, during which time she had exposed a little
red face and a pair of diminutive fists all ready to
begin the fierce battles of life, and towards which
the lady did not deign to look.</p>

<p>"But it's a pretty thing," she continued. "Look
at it, ma'am; it's as fat and plump as a baby three
weeks old, and sleeps as quietly as though it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
not been born in such a terrible storm. The pretty
dear!"</p>

<p>"How is she?" coolly interrupted the stately
lady. "Your patient above stairs, I mean; is she
comfortable?"</p>

<p>"Of course she is&mdash;they always are, ma'am."
And she chuckled a low, unmusical laugh which
accorded well with the mingled murmurings of the
expiring storm without.</p>

<p>"Tell me more of her," demanded the lady imperiously.
"Will she recover soon?"</p>

<p>"I think so ma'am; but she will need a long
rest. She is sleeping now as gentle as a kitten.
But she was pert enough, I can tell you, when she
knew she had a little girl. She actually laughed
and said she was '<i>so</i> glad,' and was going to call it
Lily Pearl. 'That will be <i>our</i> pet names joined; he
called me Lily and I called him Pearl. Lily-Pearl,
<i>that</i> shall be her name.' And I thought I would
name her as she wished, it will do no harm. It will
be a queer thing to fix into Blunt; but we shall
get used to it."</p>

<p>The lady frowned, but there might have been
seen a moisture in her large dark eyes, as though
the heart had sent up a little maternal love from
its hidden depths, yet her stern cold words checked
them, and they did not reveal it.</p>

<p>"You remember our contract?" she interrogated.</p>

<p>"O yes, ma'am; I am to have two hundred dollars
upon the spot, and a hundred and fifty every
year until the child is five years old; and then we
are to have a new bargain, and if I keep the girl I
shall expect you to do something handsome, for
you know she will be of no earthly use to <i>me</i> before
that time, nor after for that matter, if she is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
better than my Maria." Here the woman paused,
for the infant on her lap threw up its tiny fists and
uttered a feeble cry.</p>

<p>"Poor thing. It's cold, and will want something
to eat pretty soon," she continued as she folded the
soft flannel again around it.</p>

<p>"I see you have not forgotten the <i>reward</i>; your
duties, I hope, are equally clear to your memory."</p>

<p>"O yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Well then, I do not want <i>her</i> to see the child
again! It will be so much easier for her to forget
that she ever had one. It is no doubt a lawful
child as she asserts, as far as her age can make it
so&mdash;but as I told you she is only fifteen and a few
years will cover up this night forever! As soon as
it is light, take it to your home and care for it as
you will; that is, be a mother to it and <i>I</i> will take
care of the rest. But remember one thing! I
demand you to forget that she <i>ever</i> mentioned the
silly name of 'Lily Pearl!' Call her anything else
you please; let me see,&mdash;Phebe, yes&mdash;that will do!
<i>Phebe Blunt!</i> Now leave her with me for a few
moments and return to the chamber, she may need
you by this time. But stay a moment;" and the
lady reached out her hands to receive the little
bundle.</p>

<p>"Can you not keep her dozy&mdash;<i>sleepy</i>, I mean for
a short time until she gains a little strength? She
will need it you know in order to bear the news,
she will be obliged to hear! Are you sufficiently
skilled in your profession to do this without injury?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I am ma'am! It's what she needs,
and if we don't there will be no pacifying her
about her baby."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can tell her;" replied the lady, "If she is
troublesome, that she is not able to see it at present;
she must wait awhile! Now go!"</p>

<p>The woman obeyed and with a cat-like tread left
the room a very significant smile lighting her hard
features; and the little babe who had just entered
upon a life of storms and tempests lay still and motionless
upon the rich dress of the beautiful lady
who should have wound her jeweled arms about the
tiny form and vowed to protect the helpless one in
whose veins her own blood was coursing; from the
terrors of the threatening blasts. But pride and
an unnatural ambition had taken the place of the
love that had once ruled her heart and better nature,
and the good God had give her knelt in humble
subjugation at their feet.</p>

<p>She uncovered the little features before her and
gazed long and fixedly upon them, while her
thoughts ran back over the short path which had
wound so pleasantly along through the last fifteen
years since her own beautiful Lillian lay upon her
lap, the idol of him who had fallen by the flowery
way over which her memory was wandering; and
for a time it stopped by a grassy mound at which
she often knelt in the twilight hour under the
shadows of the fir tree, and a tear fell upon the innocent
upturned face; and a low wail penetrated
her ear. For a moment she pressed the tiny form
to her heaving bosom and her heart whispered,
"She shall not want&mdash;<i>I</i> will care for her&mdash;my Lillian's
babe!" She took the little hand in hers and
pressed it to her lips, and then with an impulse unpremeditated
she unfastened its dress and exposed
the pretty pink shoulders to view. She started,
and a faint cry broke from her lips which awoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the slumbering echoes in the room. Upon either
shoulder a little purple spot was plainly visible, the
same over which her maternal pride had lamented
sixteen years before! There they were&mdash;the very
same! With a tremor of deep regret she hastily
covered them again and wrapped the soft warm
blankets about it tenderly as she laid it down once
more upon her lap. A few moments later the
timid Maria entered to take the babe to the kitchen,
and with an assumed hauteur the lady yielded
up her charge and it was carried from the room.
The fury of the storm had passed, though there were
clouds still lurking in the sky and the dismal Atlantic
kept up its fitful roar; but the winds had
ceased and the rain drops fell leisurely from the
eaves down upon the gravel walks, and the old
house-dog slept quietly in his kennel by the gate.
But greater than the storm without had been, was
the tumult of emotion that was still raging in the
bosom of her who now walked with unsteady step
up and down the spacious parlor with folded hands
and care-worn expression on her handsome face,
which many long years with all their changes and
bereavements could not have placed there. "It
must be!" she exclaimed at last, and slowly leaving
the room she ascended to a distant chamber where
her daughter,&mdash;her beautiful Lillian, lay pale and
restless on her bed in an unnatural sleep.</p>

<p>The mother drew aside the thick folds of the
curtains which shut her in and gazed fixedly upon
her waxen features. How wan they looked! The
rose tints were all faded from her cheeks and lips;
and face seemed as cold and white as though just
chiseled from the unfeeling marble by the cunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hand of art. By and by the white lips moved and
a few audible words escaped them.</p>

<p>"She is dreaming" the mother thought, and
bent her stately head to listen. "It is ours&mdash;my
Pearl&mdash;our sweet Lily&mdash;<i>ours</i>, I am dying&mdash;dying&mdash;Pearl&mdash;Lily!"
The curtains fell again around the
uneasy sleeper and with a wildly throbbing heart
the wretched mother sank down upon a chair and
buried her face in her hands, while the angel of
maternal pity came and rolled away the stone from
the sealed fountain of her tears, and she wept!</p>

<p>Three days with their gloomy nights dragged
laggardly and wearily by, and the tall lady in
black bent tenderly over the pale languid form on
the bed, bathing the white brow and striving to
arouse her from the long stupor by endearing
words and soft caresses.</p>

<p>"Mother," she said at last; "bring my babe to
me will you? I want to see her sweet face before
I die! Love her Mother, and call her your own
precious Lillian,&mdash;give her <i>my</i> room and tell her
when old enough to understand that there the life
began which withered and died when its beautiful
blossom budded into life! Will you Mother?"</p>

<p>"You are not going to die my daughter! You
are very weak now, it is true, but you will soon be
stronger. Wait until then, for it would be disastrous
for you to see her now. The excitement
might overcome you. Wait dear&mdash;your mother
knows best. Close your eyes and rest. Just as
soon as it is proper you shall see your babe." And
she kissed the pale brow with hot quivering lips,
and turned away to gain new strength from the
vile spirit within for the conflict through which it
was to lead her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>A week more and the cry of the mother's heart
for its first born would not be hushed.</p>

<p>"My daughter," whispered the weeping mother,
"believe me, my poor, <i>poor</i> child! <i>This</i> is the
bitterest hour of my life, for the words your entreaties
compel me to utter will fall sadly on your
heart my poor Lillian! But it must be done!
Bear them my daughter with all the fortitude of
which you are capable!" The lips that were already
polluted with the falsehoods they were about
to utter pressed the white ashy ones of her child as
the demon of remorse was introduced into the
chamber of her soul which was to poison ever after
the fountain of her existence, and people her midnight
vigils with spectral fears.</p>

<p>"It is all for the best! Think so my darling
and do not grieve that God has transplanted your
beautiful Lily to a more genial clime before its
purity was soiled by the contaminations of this
tainted life. It is safe now; and by and by it shall
be given back to you, and with this assurance do
not murmur!" Her words fell unheeded upon ears
that were sealed from all earthly sounds; but <i>they
were heard</i>! The dark, <i>dark</i> falsehood was registered
in letters of fire where no mortal hand could
ever blot them out. How true that "upon the
wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone,
and a horrible tempest, and this shall be the portion
of their cup."</p>

<p>"I have killed her! I have killed her!" almost
shrieked the miserable mother, and with a trembling
hand she frantically rang the bell. Little
Maria immediately appeared, and with as much
composure as she could command the lady asked if
Mother was still in the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"No ma'am, she's just gone," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then <i>run</i> for her! Hasten, O hasten!"
pleaded the miserable woman, and the child obeyed.
Rapidly did she chafe the cold hands of the insensible
Lillian, but no "comforter" came to the sin-stained
heart to drive away its despair. Many
moments passed and she was alone with the
motionless form of her for whom she would sixteen
years before have laid down her life. What agonizing
thoughts burned themselves into her brain
as she watched the feebly returning breath and
saw with a bound of joy the soft tint steal again
into the closed lips. At last the eyes were slowly
opened and fixed themselves on the blanched face
bending over her. Then came a whisper so feeble
that the stately head bent low to listen. "I am
better now. Kiss me Mother. Let me lay my head
on your bosom, and sing to me as you used to do!
Hark! how the ocean roars! Listen&mdash;it is calling&mdash;calling&mdash;my
Lily, my noble Pearl. O my husband,
when may he come to me? We are not
children! Am I not a mother? Is he not the
father of my child?"</p>

<p>"Do <i>not</i>, Lillian, you are very ill! Have you
forgotten what your father told you? He is where
your babe has gone you know; but his last words
were: 'My daughter; trust your mother always,
and be guided by her superior wisdom.' I am older
than you and know what is best for one in your
present position; and if you will wait and be quiet
all things will come out right at last."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother. Let us go home where the odor
of the orange-blossoms will bring me back to life,
and Old Auntie can tell me all about it! <i>Her</i> little
ones were all taken, and I never knew how her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
poor heart ached. I think I dreamed Mother, for
I saw my pretty Lily carried away from me
and I could not reach it although I stretched out
my arms to possess her! O Mother! Mother! <i>Is
my child dead</i>?" and the large eyes looked with a
steady gaze into the blanched face of her only
parent, who was chafing with a caressing motion
the little white hand that was lying so lifelessly
in her own. In vain did the pallid lips strive to
answer but no word came to them.</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> my <i>child dead</i>?" she asked again without
removing her eyes.</p>

<p>"<i>Dead</i>, my daughter," at last fell from her icy
lips, and another sin-stain was stamped on her already
polluted soul that an ocean of tears could
never wash away.</p>

<p>"<i>Dead</i>" she murmured, and the beautiful eyes
again closed while the wretched mother sat by and
trembled.</p>

<p>In the darkness that enveloped her how gladly
would the soul have looked up for one little ray of
light and comfort, but the pall of sin, the thick
darkness of an abiding 'remorse' had settled down
over every glimmering hope and not a gladsome
beam of light could penetrate its dense folds.
Poor soul! More terrible than the storm that had
swept over the sea, when the words of the dark
falsehood were registered where no mortal hand
could blot them out, were the commotions of the
tempest tossed soul as the mother watched on and
the moments went wearily by!</p>

<p>"Dead!" again whispered the pale lips. "My
Lily, my Pearl! Gone&mdash;all, all are gone! Take
me home Mother&mdash;the ocean roars&mdash;the dark
waves are rolling over your poor Lillian;&mdash;let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
go home," and the beautiful head turned wearily
upon its pillow and the wretched watcher moaned
in her anguish; for she was <i>alone</i>!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3><a name="THE_LITTLE_MARINER_ALONE_UPON_THE_OCEAN" id="THE_LITTLE_MARINER_ALONE_UPON_THE_OCEAN"></a>THE LITTLE MARINER ALONE UPON THE OCEAN.</h3>


<p>Six years! How short each succeeding round
appears when one has almost reached the mountain's
top-most peak of life's upward course and
knows that soon his feet must be going rapidly
down upon the other side, where his journey ends!
But almost interminable their length to the weary
little foot-sore traveler who wanders alone at its
base ever looking upward to the green spots on
the hillside with restless longings. Poor little
Phebe! The first words that fell upon her unappreciative
ear were mingled with the requiem
notes over departed summer, and it had come for
the sixth time since that eventful night with its
soft breezes and sweet melodies&mdash;with its beautiful
flowers and singing birds, and filled the heart of
the lonely child full of the glorious sunshine.
Now she could sit upon the beach and watch the
white sails that floated away over the waters where
the golden beams kept dancing and skipping about
upon the waves, and listen to the deep, low murmurings
of the sea that seemed to sing to her
mysterious songs, until the angry passions within
would grow calm and fairy forms would lead her
away to that far-off land where in dreams she often
wandered. Poor little Phebe! She <i>was</i> an unfortunate
child "always in the way, never good for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
anything, doing nothing she ought but always the
very thing she should <i>not</i>." Never in favor, at
least with her foster-mother, who almost daily declared
"that the paltry hundred and fifty dollars
didn't begin to pay for the trouble and expense of
the disagreeable child," and yet it would have been
no very easy task to compute the cost of the
scanty meal which twice each day fell to the little
outcast child to whom the thriving, ambitious Mrs.
Blunt gave a shelter. Sure it was that a goodly
sum was stored away in the old oak chest which
would never have been there had the "troublesome
child" not found her way into the fisherman's
cottage.</p>

<p>True, there was nothing that was winning about
the diminutive figure with the sunburnt face. An
unusual growth of thick dark-brown hair was kept
conveniently "cropped," in defiance of science or
taste, close to her well-rounded head, and a pair of
large hazel eyes seemed to be always penetrating
the secret depths of hearts where no welcome
greeted them. Her dress too did not set off her
little dumpy figure to the best advantage, although
it was often of the finest material, being generally
the cast-off garments of the "misses" of the Cliff
House, which were duly sent every season by a
servant who was commanded to "inquire after the
little girl" and always returned with a favorable
report. These the child wore regardless of size or
fitness, and as she wandered alone upon the beach
with her sad face and thoughtful eyes turned upward
gazing into the deep blue sky or away in the
dreamy distance one might have been pardoned
for calling the queer little figure gnome, or witch,
as the fancy struck him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where under the sun has that little imp gone
to now!" exclaimed Mrs. Blunt entering the room
one day where her daughter Maria, a pale, sickly
girl of sixteen, was sitting, as she deposited her
basket of vegetables upon the bare floor in no very
amiable mood.</p>

<p>"I do declare! She's the most provoking creature
I ever saw! I told her to have all the knives
scoured before I came in from the garden and
positively there has only <i>two</i> of them been touched
and <i>they</i> are lying out there in the sun growing
blacker than ever and she is nowhere to be seen!
I don't know <i>what</i> to do with her! It don't do a
bit of good to whip her&mdash;not a bit&mdash;and I don't
know as anything but <i>killing</i> would effect her at
all!" She smiled feebly as this last observation
fell from her lips, while the daughter laughed outright.</p>

<p>"No it don't!" said the girl, quickly seeing that
the fury of the storm had for the time passed and
the mother was about to lift the basket and pass
into the kitchen; "it don't do a bit of good to whip
her! It only makes her mad and more willful!
Suppose we try coaxing for a time just to see how
it will work. I think there is good in her but
cross words will never bring it out!"</p>

<p>"There is one thing about it! If we don't hear
from that woman before a great while she may go
and find some one to coax her besides <i>me</i>; I don't
like her well enough to begin!"</p>

<p>"I presume she has not come back from Europe
yet," said the daughter musingly; then she spoke
more audibly. "I wouldn't send her off yet,
Mother; remember we have almost enough for
Father to buy a fishing smack of his own, then we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
shall be quite rich," and the blue eyes of the pale
face lighted up with the anticipation.</p>

<p>"<i>Humph!</i> Well she has got to do better than
she has if she wants to stay here!" and with this
satisfactory conclusion she disappeared with her
basket through the narrow door into the kitchen.
Maria quietly laid aside her knitting and went out
where upon a wooden bench standing on one side
of the humble cottage lay the neglected knives
which she in a very short time polished and put
away in the narrow wicker basket on the dresser,
then taking her neatly starched sun bonnet from
its nail in the entry and placing it on her head
passed out through the garden down a narrow footpath
across the common to the sea shore. She was
in quest of the truant Phebe, and well did she
know where to find her. Walking along a few
rods by the sandy beach she came suddenly to the
foot of a steep ascent whose side facing the sea
was almost entirely composed of precipitous rocks
unevenly thrown together, while here and there a
stunted pine or a yellow clump of moss struggled
for existence. Here too, half way down the rugged
descent Phebe lay concealed in her cozy retreat,
sheltered from the summer sun by the rocks above
her, with an uninterrupted view of the boundless
ocean spread out to her delighted gaze. In a few
moments Maria was sitting by her side. She did
not seem at all surprised at the presence of her
visitor, but raising herself remarked quietly:
"Maria how <i>can</i> those birds stand on the water
out there? <i>I</i> can't do it. I wish <i>I</i> could lie down
on that wave that keeps rocking&mdash;rocking and
singing&mdash;why can't I Maria? Hark! Do they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
talk to you&mdash;the waves? Did they ever say 'come
here? come here?' They do to <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> a queer child!" replied Maria impatiently,
forgetting for the time the grand purpose
of her visit. "But why don't you try to be
a good girl and do as Mother wants to have you?
This morning she told you to scour the knives
which you know is your work every day, and <i>why</i>
didn't you stay and do it and not make her so
cross with you?"</p>

<p>"'Cause&mdash;" interrupted the child; "I don't like
to scour knives and I ain't a-going to!"</p>

<p>"You don't like to be <i>whipped</i> either," answered
Maria; "but you know Mother will do it if you
don't mind her!"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't much care," said the child, shrugging
her shoulders, as she settled herself down with
calm composure.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't care <i>much</i>. I'll be big some day, and
then she won't <i>dare</i>! O Maria, see that wave
dash up on the rock, and break all to pieces. Somehow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind the waves; I want to talk to you.
Do you love me, Phebe?"</p>

<p>"Love you? What is <i>that</i>? I don't love nothing,"
and then starting up and rubbing both her
dirty hands across her brown forehead, an act she
always performed when some new thought flashed
up from within, she exclaimed: "O, Maria! last
night, when Father and Mother thought I was asleep
in my trundle-bed, I heard her say that somebody
had paid lots of money for me or something; and
then she laughed and said I didn't look much like
a 'lily,' and guessed that if my mother could see
me now, she'd be glad 'cause my name wasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
'Lily-Pearl.' O Maria! <i>What</i> did she mean?
'<i>Lily-Pearl!</i>' I keep saying it all the time.
That's my name; and O it's such a pretty one.
Lily-Pearl! Pearls come up out of the ocean. The
teacher said so the other day, and I guess <i>that's</i>
what makes <i>me</i> love the sea so much. <i>Who</i> is my
mother, Maria? And what makes you call me
Phebe Blunt, when it's Lily-Pearl? I don't like it,
and I won't have such an ugly name. Tell me,
who <i>is</i> my mother?" Maria was a long time silent,
while a deeper pallor overspread her face. But
the large, wondering eyes of her interrogator were
fixed intently upon it. How <i>could</i> she answer?
It was a secret that never was to be mentioned;
yet well did she know that Phebe would never rest
with this sly peep into the exciting mystery, and
it would be as well to satisfy her now as any time,
and so she said mildly:</p>

<p>"I don't know, Phebe, who your mother is; but
she was beautiful, and without doubt rich, and, I
think, would have been very glad to have kept
you, had it not been for her proud, wicked mother,
who did not think it best, and so you came to live
with us. Now, wasn't Mother kind to take care of
you when a little baby, and shouldn't <i>you</i> try to be
good, and do as she tells you, to pay her for her
trouble?"</p>

<p>Phebe was silent for a moment, while her
thoughtful eyes were penetrating the deep blue far
away. "No," she said at last. "She might have
thrown me back into the sea, where the pearls
grow. But I <i>knew she wasn't my</i> mother," she
continued musingly, as she pointed her finger in
the direction of the cottage.</p>

<p>"What made you think so?" asked Maria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because, if she was, she would kiss me like
Lutie Grant's mother does. She always says,
'good morning, daughter,' and kisses her when
she goes to school. I wonder what good it does,
though," she continued, musingly. "<i>I</i> was never
kissed in my life."</p>

<p>"That is <i>one</i> way to love," answered Maria with
a smile. "Now will you be a good little girl if <i>I</i>
kiss you and love you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe so," was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>Maria put her arms around the child's neck and
drew her towards her, imprinting upon her lips
a hearty kiss.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! <i>That's</i> nothing!" she replied, disdainfully.
"Is that love, Maria?"</p>

<p>"No; it was a kiss. If you loved me, you
wouldn't say <i>pshaw!</i> but kiss me as I did you.
Now come, let us go to the house. Remember, I
have told you a secret about your mother and this
will make us friends. You must not tell any one,
or even speak about the beautiful lady for Mother
would be very angry because I talked about it;
and don't forget that you promised to be just as
good as you can be, which I am sure will be all
right, and by and by we shall all love you.
Come!"</p>

<p>"I shan't go! She will want me to wash potatoes,
or something, and I <i>won't</i> do it."</p>

<p>"But you promised that you would be a good
girl if I would love you, and this is not keeping
your promise."</p>

<p>"O <i>you</i> don't love me; you only want me to go
home and scour knives, and I don't like to scour
knives, and I <i>won't</i>, either."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Mother will whip you when you do come
home, and I don't like to see you whipped; why
won't you come now?"</p>

<p>Phebe looked at her companion with surprise.
She had never heard her talk so gently and feelingly
before. For a moment she was almost
tempted to yield. Maria saw her advantage and
once more urged the willful child to accompany her.
Phebe's eyes turned again towards the sea.</p>

<p>"O Maria, Maria! see that big wave chase the
other clear up on the sand!"</p>

<p>And the little dumpy form swayed to and fro
while her large eyes glistened. Maria turned
hopelessly away. Her experiment had failed. "The
child is past redemption," she thought, as she
walked moodily home. Phebe sat a long time gazing
out from her rocky "eyrie" by the sea, thinking
over and over again the little story to which
she had just listened, and wondering how the beautiful
lady looked; and if she really was her mother,
and if, instead of being brought by an angel, as
Lutie Grant said her little sister was, she had been
picked up from off the ocean by somebody she had
never seen, and so they called her "Lily-Pearl!"
By and by a sudden impulse took possession of
her.</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> go and see where that sail boat was
going that had just rounded the point yonder!"
It had disappeared from sight, but <i>where</i> had it
gone? With rapid steps she ascended the rocks,
and ran up the hill with her utmost speed and then
descended into a broad, thick woodland, where for
a time she forgot her haste, listening to the music
of the birds and gathering wild flowers that were
growing all about her. Still she wandered on. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was past noonday when she emerged from the
woods and espied just before her, on a slight elevation,
a beautiful house&mdash;the house where she
was born! There was nothing here, however,
to reveal the interesting fact to the little wanderer,
and so she traveled on, stopping only for a
moment to peep through the heavy iron gate at two
pretty children who were playing in the yard, skipping
and jumping along the gravel walk; and then,
as if fearful of being discovered, started off as fast
as possible, leaping down the edge of the cliff until
she reached the sandy beach far below. Here she
stopped. The pretty sail boat that had allured her
hither was nowhere to be seen, and weary and
heated, she threw herself upon the ground and
watched the rising tide as it came dashing upon
the beach. It had risen rapidly, when suddenly
she became aware that a dark object was floating
near her on the water. It was a small row boat
often used by the inmates of Cliff House, but which
the tide had washed from its moorings, and was
now with its bow still clinging to the sandy beach,
swaying impatiently at her feet, restless as her own
adventurous spirit. With a scream of delight she
sprang into the frail bark, and soon found herself
floating steadily and rapidly away from the shore.
Now, for the first time, she was out upon the waves
where she had so longed to be, amid the sparkling
gems which the sunbeams were scattering all
around her, while the huge billows just beyond
beckoned her to follow. A small oar lay by her
feet, and with this she caressed the ripples and
drew, now and then from the unknown depths, the
dark-green seaweed that floated by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus she was borne away, unmindful of the danger
into which her wild spirit was leading her, and
heeding not the sun descending into the dark,
gloomy clouds that hung about his ocean bed, for
she was happy now; alone upon the boundless sea,
her life had become the fairy dream in which she
had so often revelled while closeted in her rocky
retreat, from which she was floating forever.</p>

<p>She was no more a child, but a wave&mdash;a billow&mdash;one
of those which had sung to her so often while
she sat and watched them, and her low, sweet voice
joined in the anthem of the sea as if it said&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="THE_WAIF_AFTER_THE_STORM" id="THE_WAIF_AFTER_THE_STORM"></a>THE WAIF AFTER THE STORM.</h3>


<p>Phebe listened to the rolling music with an
ecstasy never before experienced in her wildest
dreams, and as the winds moaned on the distant
shore and the sea-birds shrieked their sad accompaniment
to the chorus of her song, she fell
asleep hungry and weary.</p>

<p>Little slumberer, who shall guide thy frail bark,
unseen by mortal eye, over the trackless waves?
Who shall check the rising storm and temper the
fury of the winds to the poor lone lamb? An eye
is upon thee and thou cans't not perish! A sure
hand is at the helm, and the frail bark shall ride
gloriously over the angry deep, and a sweet voice
near thee shall whisper "peace, be still!"</p>

<p>It was quite dark when the rolling thunder
awoke the sleeper, and with a scream of horror she
sprang to her feet to find her alluring dreams, her
fancied bliss, all dispelled as the realities of danger
burst upon her. She called loudly, but the sea
gave only a dismal echo to her ears; she shouted
but the deep-toned thunders alone sent back a
reply. Where now was the brightness that had
so dazzled her? The sunbeams had gathered up
all their sparkling gems and with them had disappeared!
The music of the waves had died away,
the little song which a few hours before had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
bubbled up in her joyous heart was hushed, and
all was darkness and gloom. Ah, little mariner,
life is full of just such changes! Sunshine and
tempest&mdash;noonday and darkness; all intermingling
their lights and shades! Thy first great
lesson is a sad one, but it will never leave thee.
Better so than that it should be only half learned.</p>

<p>Phebe lay in the bottom of the boat famished
with hunger, wet with the drenching rain, pale
and sick, when the captain of a gallant yacht
which had "laid to" during the storm, espied from
its deck a little speck far away to leeward, apparently
lying still upon the waters.</p>

<p>"I say, Thornton," he remarked to a shipmate
near him; "isn't that a boat off yonder? Here&mdash;take
the glass! I can hardly make it out. But
it's something, whether there's any life about it
or not."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a boat clear enough," replied his companion
eyeing it intently; "but I imagine it's one
that has been washed from some ship during the
storm for there is nothing alive about it as I can
see."</p>

<p>"I think you are right so we'll leave it to its
fate."</p>

<p>In a few moments the beautiful craft had disappeared
and the little boat with its helpless occupant
was left unheeded except by Him who permits
not a sparrow to fall to the ground without his
notice. Ah&mdash;thy fate was near thee, little one but
the unseen hand has removed it and it is well!
Through the waves the yacht ploughed its way,
for the breakers were rushing back from the shore
and all on board save one returned to their berths
for the rest that had been deprived them by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
howling winds and the tossing of the staunch hull
which the day before had seemed so sure and safe
in its strength, but which the billows bore high on
their foaming crests, then dashed as a helpless
thing into the dark furrows the storm-king had
ploughed out from the angry deep as he marched
onward! O the horrors of a night spent amid a
"storm at sea!"</p>

<p>Seated in one of the state rooms was a tall,
queenly woman, robed in a rich <i>deshabille</i> of gray
silk, with her elbow resting on the window sill, her
hand supporting the head that bent wearily upon
it, while her dark eyes gazed through the heavy
plate glass out upon the black waters that kept
dashing and surging against the victorious yacht
proudly crushing the intruding waves that presumed
to cross its pathway.</p>

<p>"Mother," said a winning voice near, "why will
you not lie down awhile before breakfast? The
danger is all over, and listen! Hear how calmly
the seamen walk the deck! I presume everyone
has concluded to make up for the fearful lying
awake and will not be astir for two hours at least.
Come Mother!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I can rest here! We shall be out another
night, and it may be <i>two</i>," was the desponding reply.</p>

<p>"You used to sing 'life on the ocean wave'
Mother, and I remember your saying once that you
had no sympathy with Headley who declared that
'to sing that song by a good warm fire and being
in it were two very different experiences,' for <i>you</i>
rather enjoyed the one you passed through during
your first voyage."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, child, I remember! I was not as old then
as now;" and she might have added "and not as
<i>guilty</i> then as now;" but they passed on.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon before a coasting vessel came
in sight, and spying the little boat that was floating
amid the waves the kind-hearted captain
ordered three sturdy tars to go and capture it.</p>

<p>"Not so great a job as we've had sometimes,"
remarked one playfully.</p>

<p>"Pull away boys, see&mdash;there is something in the
bottom! Steady,&mdash;" and as they came alongside the
speaker sprang into the boat.</p>

<p>"Och&mdash;but she's dead!" exclaimed Mike, as he
raised the insensible child in his arms. "She is!
Look at her, shipmates," he continued bringing
her forward as he would a coil of rope.</p>

<p>"There isn't a bit of color in her face under the
dirt; poor wee thing!" and he passed her over to a
man with a very brown, weather-beaten face, who
laid her tenderly on some blankets and began
chafing her hands.</p>

<p>"She is <i>alive</i>, boys," he said a few minutes
after; "here Mike&mdash;pass me that little bottle I
saw you put in your pocket this morning, it looked
to me like very good brandy," he continued with a
laugh, at the same time reaching out for it.</p>

<p>"Sorra a bit of <i>brandy</i>!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, pass it over, whatever it is. For
once I'll not expose you for the good it may do
now." The small bottle was passed and the kind
man placed it to the lips of the insensible girl.</p>

<p>"Drink it, child," he said in tones as low and
soft as a woman's; "it will make you well."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Look_at_her_shipmates" id="Look_at_her_shipmates"></a>
<img src="images/fig042.jpg" width="500" height="342" alt="&quot;Look at her, shipmates!&quot;" title="&quot;Look at her, shipmates!&quot;" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not hear him; yet she did swallow
the few drops that were turned into her mouth, and
the good man's predictions proved correct, for in a
few moments she opened her eyes, but turned her
head, hid her face in the blankets on which she
was lying.</p>

<p>"She is afraid of our hard old faces," remarked
the sailor who was bending over her; "but we will
soon be where there will be more agreeable ones.
Give way, boys, they are waiting for us," and rising,
he left the "wee" stranger to herself.</p>

<p>"I should think she would have got used to
ugly faces if she has been where there's a glass,"
remarked the third of the party, rather cruelly,
but laughing and good-natured. They reached
the schooner, and the wearied child was handed
on board, amid many exclamations and intermingling
remarks of sympathy and astonishment.</p>

<p>There were two women down in the small cabin;
one the wife of Mike, who, in accordance with the
kindness natural to her people, took the little outcast
mariner under her especial care, and, with
feminine instincts, provided for her wants.</p>

<p>The next few days the diminutive figure of
Phebe Blunt sat upon the dark, dingy chest beneath
the small narrow window in the cabin, looking
out upon the blue, blue sea her beating heart
so much loved, as it gathered up the jewels of emerald,
and gold, and crystal pearls which the sunbeams
scattered upon the wavelets' snowy crests,
and with them her fancy built a palace of its own,
to which in after years memory would often return
and bear away some precious stones to adorn her
sober real life.</p>

<p>"Ye're a strange child," said Cathreen, one day,
after watching her for a long time, as she sat coiled
up on the heavy chest, her large eyes peering from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the window at the dark waters over which they
were sailing. "What makes ye look so much at
the sea? I'd rather see the land any time; and I
wouldn't care a farthing if I never put my eyes on
a bit of water again as long as I live." The child
turned her beaming face towards the speaker with
an expression of wonder and incredulity playing
over it.</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> it?" she asked at last, as her little
brown hands brushed back the mass of dark hair
from her broad forehead.</p>

<p>"Can what?" and the two women laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Walk on the water. I couldn't, and I don't
believe <i>He</i> could," and the bewildered gaze was
turned again out of the narrow window.</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i>, child? Are you beside yourself?"</p>

<p>"<i>He!</i> Lutie Grant's mother said He walked on
the great sea, but <i>I</i> don't believe it. How could
He? <i>I</i> can't."</p>

<p>"Ye don't know what ye're talking about."</p>

<p>"Yes she does," interrupted the other. "It's
Christ, the Bible tells about."</p>

<p>"And he used to love little girls, and took 'em
up and kissed 'em; she said so; but, pshaw! that's
nothing! Maria kissed <i>me</i> once, but 'twasn't
much. I'd like to walk on the water, though,"
and again the eyes sought the far-off, and dropping
her head upon her arms sat motionless as before.</p>

<p>"She's a puzzle," remarked Cathreen as she
went about her work.</p>

<p>"I'd just like to know who she is and where she
came from," remarked her companion, musingly.
"I can almost believe that she <i>did</i> come up out of
the sea, as she says, and that her name <i>is</i> 'Lily-Pearl',"
and she laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a third one who had been listening
to the conversation from the narrow stairway that
led to the deck, and entering at this moment, said,
gently:</p>

<p>"I think I know some one who would enjoy
working out this 'puzzle'," and he laid his hand
tenderly on the bushy head of the little girl.</p>

<p>"Would you like to go home with me and live?"
he asked. "You will find one there who can tell
you all about <i>Him</i> who walked on the sea and
loved little children, and I imagine he would love
<i>you</i>, too, for there is more in this little heart and
brain than is generally given to one so young and
ignorant," he continued, as he turned to the wondering
women who were listening.</p>

<p>"Ye're not going to take her home with ye <i>sure</i>,
Mr. Evans? Mike said that <i>he</i> guessed we'd take
her; she's no trouble and likes the water."</p>

<p>Phebe shrugged her shoulders and looked toward
her friend who said, pleasantly:</p>

<p>"I think I will take her home with me; and
perhaps we will hear from her mother or somebody
who will want her, some day," and patting the
rounded cheek, left the cabin and ascended to the
deck while Phebe went on with her musings, and
the two women commented on her future and the
"strange conduct of the mate." Yet, all unseen
a hand was tenderly leading the little stray lamb
back to its fold through "pastures green" and "by
the still waters," where the thorns and the briars
were scattered along its banks, and where the poor
feet would many times get torn, and the heart grow
faint; but her way is onward, for the Father leadeth
her. Somebody has said that "God will make
the blind bird's nest," and Faber once declared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
"there is hardly <i>ever</i> a complete silence in our
souls. God is whispering to us well nigh continually.
Whenever the sounds of the world die out,
then we hear these whisperings of God." Was He
not doing this to our little mariner? "They talk to
me," she would say, and in her innocence it was
the waves that talked&mdash;it was the billows that
called, but the Father's tender voice was whispering,
and his loving care was continually over
her.</p>

<p>"The wind is coming up again pretty brisk,
Mate, and I guess we shall have another rough
night," said the captain, as he met the other on his
rounds just as the darkness began to settle down
about the vessel.</p>

<p>"If it will keep in the northeast, all right; we
will reach the harbor by to-morrow," and he walked
thoughtfully on.</p>

<p>This prediction was true. In less than a half
hour the gale was tossing the billows high about
the ship, and the sky was dark and lead-colored.
Phebe would not leave the little window, although
the white foam dashed against the small panes and
the gloom without was impenetrable.</p>

<p>"Come away, child," commanded one of the women,
sharply, "what makes you keep sitting there,
when you can't see the nose on your face?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to see it," was the quick reply;
"I want to see them roll and tumble over each
other. <i>He</i> couldn't walk on it now?" she queried,
turning to the mate who had entered.</p>

<p>"But He could do something more wonderful
than that," he said, coming to her and laying his
hand on her head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The wondering eyes that were looking into the
face of the speaker grew larger and brighter and
she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!"</p>

<p>"The Bible says so, Phebe, and Willie believes
it. Hark&mdash;how the wind blows and the waves
roar! but <i>He</i> could say to them all, 'Peace, be
<i>still</i>!' and they would mind him."</p>

<p>"Stop blowing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the sea stop rolling."</p>

<p>She looked at the smiling face for a moment and
then with a shrug of the shoulders turned her eyes
again out of the window. The ship was plunging
madly in the darkness, and the occupants in the
little cabin were obliged to hold tightly on to the
railing around it to prevent being dashed together,
but Phebe kept her seat on the old weather-beaten
chest, clinging to the window for power to hold her
position, yet her face did not lose its quiet expression
for a moment.</p>

<p>"Well, little girl, I see you are not afraid," remarked
the mate, pleasantly, as he turned to go
above. "I didn't know but the storm would make
you think of your ride all alone, and would want
some of my help again."</p>

<p>"It don't rain and thunder now," she remarked
quietly. "It was awful; the waves talked, and something
said, 'Poor little Phebe! the pearls are looking
at you, and will take you down in their beautiful
home, where you belong, if the storm don't
stop'&mdash;but it did, and I went to sleep. Where are
the pearls? It's cold down there, and what made
them throw me on the waves?" Thus Phebe
mused while the winds died away and the waves
were calmed, and as the ship settled down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
quiet on the dark sea, she turned to the frightened
inmates of the cabin with the expression: "Guess
He <i>did</i>," and getting off her seat crept softly to her
bed.</p>

<p>In the elegant yacht seen in the morning, another
pair of dark eyes was gazing through the
window of the stateroom into the rapidly gathering
storm. Evidently it had changed its course,
and instead of making its way southward along
the coast, it was now laboring to gain the open sea.
The eyes were wild in their burning excitement,
as the blackness became more intense and the billows
roared as they dashed against the brave
craft. There was no gathering of the "precious
gems" into the soul of the stately lady, for her
memory was full of a sad record, from which she
could not shut her thoughts. She turned almost
fiercely towards the calm figure reclining on the
sofa opposite, exclaiming: "Lillian, you anger me.
What are you lying there for, when such a terrible
storm is out upon the sea? Do you not know that
we are not going towards Mobile at all, but are
sailing as rapidly as the winds can drive us out
into&mdash;nobody knows where?"</p>

<p>"Eternity, perhaps," was the quiet response.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to torture me, child?"</p>

<p>"This should not do it, Mother, for your pallid,
pinched face tells me that I have given you no new
thought. We are in danger, as you know, and many
have come where we are never to a shore again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmont was silent. Her wild gaze turned
once more out of the window, and the daughter
mused on.</p>

<p>At last. "If Pearl only knew, I could lie down
under a friendly billow peacefully&mdash;yes, gladly."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you persist, Lillian?"</p>

<p>"He is my husband and the father of my child."</p>

<p>A moment's silence.</p>

<p>"How terrible! That peal was directly over us!"</p>

<p>The stately head dropped upon the white arm
extended across the heavy bar of iron to which she
was clinging, while the shouts and heavy hurried
feet made a dismal accompaniment to the confusion
all about her.</p>

<p>Lillian spoke.</p>

<p>"Mother, with death in the air and on the sea,
tell me, <i>where</i> is my child?"</p>

<p>"In heaven, I hope," and for once she spoke
truly.</p>

<p>"If not there, do you know where she is?"</p>

<p>"She is there. I will not endure your suspicions,
Lillian! Never ask me concerning your child
again."</p>

<p>The stately lady attempted to rise, but fell back
insensible upon the chair. When consciousness
was restored the fury of the storm was passed, and
Mrs. Belmont, weak and dispirited, moaned upon
her bed until the sea-sick passengers landed safely
at their destination.</p>

<h3><a name="RECEPTION_NIGHT_AT_THE_NEW_HOME" id="RECEPTION_NIGHT_AT_THE_NEW_HOME"></a>RECEPTION NIGHT AT THE NEW HOME.</h3>


<p>Not many miles from Boston there stands a
small, white cottage a few rods back from the main
road, with a cool, shady lane leading to the lawn
by which it is surrounded. Around this stands
many wide-spreading maples, which cast their
shadows over roses and honeysuckles when the
sun is hottest, while the summer breezes linger
among the branches to fan the noonday loungers,
who, weary with their morning's toil in the field,
seek rest beneath their shades. In the rear a garden
stretches its way down to a little brook, which
winds itself hither and thither through the tall
meadow grass, singing softly to the gay lilies
which hang their heads over its banks. The brook
passes on through the narrow strip of pines that
had carpeted the path on its margin with soft
matting until it reaches a fair and picturesque lake,
lying snugly nestled in the bright green basin
the surrounding hills have made for it. Trees
stand upon the water's edge and dip their long,
pendant branches playfully into the blue beneath
them, and white waxen lilies with their pure petals
deck the bosom of the sleeping beauty, and
rise and fall mechanically as the breezes pass over
the surface.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>It was to this home, surrounded by green fields
and nature's beauties that George Evans, the kind-hearted
sailor, brought the unpromising prize
whom he found floating upon the waters.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful, calm summer evening when
the two stepped from the cars at the small village
of Kirkham and began their pleasant walk of some
two miles to their journey's end. The road lay
over a varied country of hills and dales, on which
the setting sun was throwing an additional charm
of golden hues, lighting up the tree tops and gilding
the quiet lake and brooklet with tints of
changing glories, crowning the distant mountain
with a chaplet of beauty, as the retiring king sank
lower and lower in his chamber of purple and
crimson behind a western cloud. The sailor was
walking slowly with bowed head, holding the little
brown hand of his <i>protegee</i> tightly in his own, unheeding
the departing splendors of the dying day,
for his thoughts were busy and his face denoted a
"mind ill at ease."</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;look!" exclaimed his little companion,
pulling away her small hand from the weather-beaten
one that was so gently leading her.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> is 'most as pretty as the sea: But it don't
talk to me," she continued, after a moment's pause.
He <i>did</i> look as she requested, but not where her
finger pointed, for his attention suddenly became
riveted upon the little upturned face beside him.</p>

<p>"If they could only see her <i>now</i>," he thought;
"what eyes! But it will be all gone when we get
there, and nothing but the old look of impishness
will remain." A smile passed over his bronzed
features as he continued to gaze at her who was
hurrying on before to gather some flowers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
grew by the road-side, and well might he be
pardoned for any remark he might be tempted to
make, for a more unlovely little image could not
well be imagined. Her dress, which had originally
been of very fine material, had lost the most of its
beauty before coming to her, and what little might
have been left disappeared during the night she
lay asleep in the bottom of the dirty fishing boat
with the rain beating upon her. To be sure it had
been washed and mended by the kind-hearted
Cathreen on board the "Bay State," but even this
process had failed to add new charms to it, for
there were many more colors (added by the several
patches) than were at first intended to be there.
This outer article of apparel, with an apology for
one other garment, was the sole covering of the
little dumpy figure; and her hair, which was very
thick and much longer than it was generally permitted
to grow, hung in confusion about her sunburnt
face.</p>

<p>They had now ascended a slight eminence which
overlooked the valley, and before them was distinctly
visible the blue lake with its green border,
and a long line of struggling sunbeams lingering
upon its bosom, while to the right, in the
midst of the evening shadows, stood the neat
white cottage with its numerous adornings; still
nearer and plainly discernable in the broad light
was a smooth white marble slab cold and chilling
as the form which had for many years rested beneath
it. This stone so motionless and still told
the passer-by that "Henry Wood," the former
owner and proprietor of the pleasant home and
those extensive fields had long ago ceased from his
labors, and the soil which his hands had so productively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
tilled was now another's, yet they were
not his who was now so thoughtfully looking over
them. When <i>he</i>, twelve years ago, stood in the
place of the buried husband, by the side of the
widowed wife, the reservation had been made. The
farm with all its accompaniments should belong
to his future companion and <i>her</i> heirs, of whom
her only daughter stood first in the rank of all
succeeding claimants.</p>

<p>One child had been born to them, a poor
crippled boy of ten years, towards whom the
father's heart always turned with all its fullness
of paternal love.</p>

<p>"Come here, Phebe," said the sailor kindly to
the busy little girl, who had her hands full of gay
flowers and leaves, as he seated himself on a stone
by the roadside. "Come here and see that house
yonder! Don't you think you would like to live
there? See that lake, it isn't quite as large as the
one I found you on, but there is a boat much prettier,
very much, than the one you took your lonely
ride in. Tell me, don't you think you would like
such a home as that?" he continued, seeing she
was gazing thoughtfully on the scene.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go <i>there</i>," she answered at last,
pointing to the green hills that surrounded the
lake.</p>

<p>"But who would feed and take care of you? Besides,
why would you not like to live in that pretty
house? There are flowers all around it, and smooth
paths through the garden down to the meadow
brook, and beside it you can walk to the lake where
the bright little row-boat is fastened to the oak
tree. Willie thinks it is very nice! We always
go there together when I am at home, and while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
we are sailing I tell him all about my voyage,
what I saw and heard, and what I hope he will see
and hear some day."</p>

<p>"Won't they make me scour knives and wash
potatoes?" asked the child, eagerly. "I don't like
to do it, and I <i>won't</i>!" she exclaimed emphatically.
"Mother used to whip me because I wouldn't do it;
but I would run away down to the shore and talk
to the waves. Do the waves talk over there?" she
said, pointing to the lake, around which the nightly
shadows were densely gathering.</p>

<p>"If they do, they will tell you it is <i>very</i> naughty
not to do what those who are so kind ask you to
do. Mothers have to do many things that are not
pleasant, and every mother's girl ought to try to
please her. Don't you think so?" Phebe shrugged
her shoulders, and drawing her hand across her
forehead, replied quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I don't like to scour knives, and I hain't
got no mother."</p>

<p>"But I want Willie's mother to be yours, and I
think she will be very kind to you, if you are good
and try to please her."</p>

<p>A shadow passed over his face, and he was silent
for a long time. When he once more aroused himself
to actual life it had grown quite dark and the
child was nowhere to be seen. He called, but she
did not answer. Hurrying down the hill he called
again; but the echoes were his only reply. For a
moment a sense of relief came over him. He had
pondered much how he should introduce his little
charge to the family circle in her most attractive
light, in order to avoid opposition as much as possible.
But she was gone, and he could now go to
his home with the expectation of a joyful greeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
from all, unless it be save one. Then his great
heart spoke.</p>

<p>No, he could not leave her to wander off alone
to perish; he <i>must</i> find her. Besides, Willie needed
a companion. Poor lonely boy, he was denied the
sports of other children, and was left alone with
his thoughts and books so much that he was growing
morbid and silent. This was pitiful in one so
young, and it may be that he needed just such a
play-fellow as this to draw him away from himself;
and he would find her.</p>

<p>Hurrying on he did not stop until he had reached
his own door, and to his great surprise he beheld
Phebe in the little sitting room surrounded by the
family circle, who seemed to be enjoying their
strange guest to the utmost. He stepped quickly
back into the deeper shadows and listened. They
were evidently trying to find out something of her
history, for Willie asked:</p>

<p>"But where did you come from? You can tell
us <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"I came from way down in the ocean, where the
pearls grow, that is what my beautiful mother
called me Lily-Pearl for."</p>

<p>A hearty laugh succeeded this answer, while
Fanny remarked, ironically:</p>

<p>"I should imagine she had sprung out of <i>some</i>
dark cavern; but there is not much of the appearance
of the pearl family about her."</p>

<p>"What made you come <i>here</i>?" inquired Mrs.
Evans, kindly; "did any one send you?"</p>

<p>"I thought I'd just come and see if you'd make
me scour knives and wash potatoes; 'cause, if you
would, I don't want to live here. I don't like to
do it and I <i>won't</i>!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a strange child," remarked Willie. "I
wish I could keep her; I should like her <i>so</i> much."</p>

<p>"Like me? Does <i>that</i> mean <i>love</i>? Would you
kiss me and say, 'Good-bye, dear,' as Lutie Grant's
mother does? Maria kissed me once, but <i>that</i> was
nothing," and she shrugged her shoulders with an
impatient gesture of contempt.</p>

<p>"Kiss her," exclaimed Fanny; "I would as soon
kiss one of our pigs."</p>

<p>Mr. Evans from the shadow saw the flash in the
large dark eyes, as they turned upon the speaker,
and thought it time to make his appearance known.
As he entered the door Phebe ran to him with outstretched
arms, and exclamations of pleasure, while
the eager hands of the little lame boy were reached
out towards him, and soon clasped in the strong,
loving embrace of the happy father. The wife
came forward for her share of joyful greetings, but
the daughter kept her seat by the table where she
was sewing, extending her hand only as the father
approached, but he bowed his head and kissed her
brow with a fondness that was not returned.</p>

<p>"Well, Phebe, what made you run away from
me?" he asked, turning to the little girl who was
still clinging to him, and laying his hand tenderly
on her bushy head. "You wanted to introduce
yourself, did you? Didn't you know I was very
much frightened? I thought, perhaps you had
run away to the woods where you seemed so anxious
to go and live."</p>

<p>"And where you picked her up, I should imagine,"
remarked Fanny, without raising her eyes
from her work.</p>

<p>"Not quite so bad as that, is it, Phebe? But
we will talk about that by and by," and unfolding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a large bundle which he had brought with him
he handed Willie some books which made his blue
eyes sparkle; then a parcel to his wife and another
to the daughter, while a third he held in his hand.</p>

<p>"Here are some dresses for Phebe, which I think
will serve to win for herself a trifle more affection
than she can expect to get in her present outfit," he
said with a smile.</p>

<p>Unfolding some bright calicoes, he called the
little girl to him.</p>

<p>"Won't you look pretty when you have these
new dresses on?" he asked kindly.</p>

<p>"Lutie Grant never wore prettier clothes than
these will be!"</p>

<p>This had the desired effect. How her eyes sparkled
and danced with the anticipation.</p>

<p>"Why, isn't she handsome, Father? Where <i>did</i>
you find her?"</p>

<p>He gave a communicating look to his son and
said;</p>

<p>"Tell Willie where I found you, will you?"</p>

<p>"'Way out on the ocean," she said, evasively.</p>

<p>"What were you doing there?" Willie again
asked.</p>

<p>"I wanted to go out on the waves and hear what
they said. I couldn't tell what they said when I
was on the rocks."</p>

<p>"You said you came from way down in the sea
where the pearls grew."</p>

<p>"And so I <i>did</i>, but not now. A beautiful lady
picked me up. Will <i>you</i> call me Lily-Pearl?" she
asked, coming close to Willie and taking his soft,
white hand in hers. "I'll be good, then."</p>

<p>"And do what Willie's mother asks you to do?"
interrupted Mr. Evans; but there was no answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me call you Lily <i>Evans</i>; that's my name,
you know, and if you are to be my sister, we must
love each other, and I shall want to have you like
my name, too. Shall I?" Phebe shrugged her
shoulders, and the old unpleasant look came back
to her face.</p>

<p>"Then you don't want me for your brother? I
thought you were going to love me, and we would
be happy together."</p>

<p>Phebe stole more closely to his side, and looking
up into the pale face whispered, timidly, "Will
you kiss me, Willie?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I will, and <i>love</i> you, too&mdash;I know I
shall!" and the boy kissed heartily the little upturned
face just as Fanny's sneering laugh reached
her. The flash of indignation darted to her dark
eyes, which her kind protector had seen there more
than once, and well did he understand the foe that
was lurking beneath.</p>

<p>"I think little Phebe must be tired; can you
find a place for her to sleep, Mother?" he asked
soothingly, at the same time drawing her towards
him. "Good night, my little girl; I hope you will
have pleasant dreams, and to-morrow we will talk
about the new dresses." He kissed her fondly as
he spoke, and the face beamed with joy as she left
the room.</p>

<p>There was a long family consultation that night
after the child had been shown to her bed, and for
the first time in her whole life made to repeat the
simple prayer: "Now I lay me down to sleep,"
which she did reluctantly, and with many shrugs.
But the quiet, earnest voice of Mrs. Evans subdued
her, and she at last submitted with a very
good grace. It was finally decided before the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
separated for the night, that the new-comer
should for a time, at least, become an inmate of the
home circle, and through Willie's solicitations she
should be considered his exclusive property. He
would be her teacher, guiding all her studies, filling
her little untutored mind with the knowledge
he had gained, as well as endeavoring to correct
her faults; while she in return would be his companion,
drawing him in his carriage and amusing
him generally. It was with a light heart that the
poor lame boy lay down to sleep that night.
Bright visions of coming happiness flitted through
his mind, and succeeded in driving away his
usually quiet slumbers.</p>

<p>The next morning he arose early and soon after
"Lily," as he persisted at the time in calling her,
notwithstanding Fanny's sarcastic protestations,
appeared in a neat chintz frock and pink apron
which had not been taken out from their hiding
place since the baby boy had grown too large for
their use. Her hair was smoothly parted back
from the forehead and her face was beaming and
animated. She bounded quickly to Willie's side
as she entered the room where breakfast was waiting,
and inquired eagerly: "Do I look pretty?"
"To be sure you do; just as pretty as any other
girl!"</p>

<p>"I want to tell you something," she leaned over
to whisper as she was being lifted to her seat by
the side of her future companion; "I love <i>you</i>, but
I <i>hate</i> Fanny!" "You must not hate any one,"
replied Willie. "Fanny is my sister and you are
going to be, so we must <i>all</i> love each other." "I
can't," and the little dumpy figure raised itself to
its fullest dimensions as she looked into the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of Fanny, who was coming into the room with the
coffee. "I <i>won't</i> love <i>her</i>, but I love <i>you</i>," and
she clasped the little white hand fervently in her
own.</p>

<h3><a name="DEATH_IN_THE_LITTLE_COTTAGE" id="DEATH_IN_THE_LITTLE_COTTAGE"></a>DEATH IN THE LITTLE COTTAGE.</h3>


<p>Phebe was not mistaken in her heart's emotions,
as the years proved. She <i>did</i> love Willie with all
of the ardor of her young affections. His wish
was her law; his reproofs her severest chastisements.
But the stern, cold Fanny found no place
in her love. She trembled under her frowns and
anger only to hasten from them that she might
hide the bitterness which her secret tears could
alone soothe. There was no need of all this.
Fanny did not <i>hate</i> the child; no, not even dislike
her; but there was no summer within her soul&mdash;no
glad sunshine in her obdurate heart. Yet beneath
the icy covering the world saw, which
chilled and frosted the tendrils of love her woman's
nature possessed, there was a clear silvery fountain
of emotion, which would have driven away many
a dark hour, with the merry music of its gushing
waters, had not a thick cloud of selfishness shut it
in, and the frosts of discontent sealed it from human
vision. But God saw it all, and looked pityingly
into the perverted heart where its rich treasures
lay hidden. "The child is very well," she
would say, "as good as children usually are, I suppose,
but of no use. She does not pay for the salt
she eats."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not agree with you," replied the mother.
"See how much happier your brother is since he
has a companion to talk to and confide in. <i>I</i> was
too old to understand his little wants, or even to
sympathize with his poor heart's sorrows. I feel
it all now. This is the lesson I have learned since
Phebe has been with us. We were too selfish,
Fanny&mdash;your mother and yourself. It may be I
was at fault in not tilling and uprooting the evils
in your young heart when it was in my power to do
so, my daughter, and I am willing to confess it to
you now. There should be more flowers growing
in the garden of our souls, and less hardy, sturdy
shrubs that yield no fragrance and woo no summer
birds to come and make music for us. Life has
changed its aspects for me within a few short
months. It seems all spread out where I can look
back upon it; <i>not</i> sparkling and glowing with good
works and love and gentleness, as it should be;
but there are dark places&mdash;cold, chill damps that
creep over me at times when I scan the crooked
paths over which I have led you, while one so
smooth and flowery, so full of pleasant places
and radiant with beauty, is plainly discernable
close beside it, into which our feet should have
turned. God forgive me!" she murmured, while
a tear glistened for one moment in her clear blue
eyes. "I did not mean to do you a wrong; I was
worldly and ambitious for your <i>temporal</i> good, but
blinded to your spiritual prosperity. God forgive
me!"</p>

<p>"I cannot see where you have committed any
such a great sin," replied the daughter with much
feeling. "I have no doubt but that you intended to
to do your duty, and must say my opinion is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
you succeeded well. We had to toil hard to gain
our present ease and comfort, but no one can accuse
us of either crime or dishonesty, Mother. I did
not speak of the child because I did not want her
here. I only think she might make herself more
useful. I am willing she should read when Willie
wants her to, but she would never do anything else
if she could help it."</p>

<p>The door was suddenly opened and Phebe came
rushing in, with a light buoyant step, her cheeks
glowing with exercise and her dark eyes sparkling
with joy and animation.</p>

<p>"O Mother! Father is in Boston, but will not be
home for two or three days. You can <i>never</i> guess
what he has for Willie," and the happy child
danced about the floor in the exuberance of her
glee.</p>

<p>"What business have you to open our letters?"
inquired Fanny, beneath the dark cloud that had
gathered during the short recital.</p>

<p>The mirth of the little girl suddenly ceased as
she looked at her interrogator for a moment, but
made no reply. Willie, however, appeared in the
door and answered for her.</p>

<p>"The letter was written to <i>us</i>, wasn't it, Phebe?"</p>

<p>"It was written to <i>you</i>; and Father is going to
bring him a large dog all trained to draw him. O
Willie, was there ever anything so nice!" Her
quick anger was gone, and the brightness of the
joyous anticipations of the <i>something</i> that was to
bring so much to one she so dearly loved daguerreotyped
itself on her expressive features. Willie
saw it all, and when he had seated himself by the
side of his mother on the lounge he beckoned
Phebe to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are sorry about something, my little sister,"
he said; "tell me what it is."</p>

<p>"No, no; I am not sorry. I was only thinking.
You will not want little Phebe when Rover comes.
And&mdash;and I <i>do</i> like to draw you so much!" and
her lips quivered as she strove to keep back the
tears.</p>

<p>"Why, my pretty sister, your eyes were so
bright when I first told you, and I thought that
my new possessions were going to make <i>you</i> as
happy as myself; and only a moment ago you exclaimed,
'was there ever anything so <i>nice</i>!' Can
you not think so now? It is true I shall not need
you for my horse," he continued, laughing. "But
just think how dreary it will be to ride alone, with
no one to speak to or enjoy the sunshine and cool
breezes with me, or gather the pretty flowers along
the road, or the lilies from off the lake! No, no,
Phebe; I <i>cannot</i> go alone, and Father may take the
dog back, if you will not go with me. Or perhaps
you imagine that Rover can talk, as well as
do many other remarkable things. Besides you
must have forgotten that Father wrote that the
wagon is large enough for two such 'chicks' as we
are. So do not feel badly; you are to go with me,
and Rover is to draw us both."</p>

<p>Mrs. Evans clasped them in her arms and drew
them tenderly to her.</p>

<p>"My dear children, will you always love each
other as you do now? Will you always be his sister
Phebe, and never take away the affection that
makes him so happy? I shall not always be with
with you, my children; but before I leave you,
promise me, Phebe, that you will <i>never</i> forsake
him, and I will trust you, young as you are. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
time will come when both of you will pass beyond
these years of childhood, and great changes may
come to you; there will be separations, and other
homes where it may be you will live apart. But,
Phebe, he is your brother; remember <i>I</i> have given
him to you. It is a sacred trust, but you understand
it. Will it be kept safe and firm when he
has no mother to lean upon, and no hand but yours
to attend to his wants? Phebe, I love you, and
thank God every day that he sent the lonely
'mariner' to our home, and for the sake of that
love will you be true to my dear boy?"</p>

<p>"I could never live without Willie," and she
threw her arms passionately around the neck of
the crippled boy. "I will never leave him
Mother; he couldn't do without <i>me</i>, could you
Willie?" The boy drew her more closely to him
but could not speak, for his heart was full of his
mother's sad words. He had noticed that her
cheek had paled with the fading of the summer
flowers; that her step had grown more feeble and
her kiss more tender as she smoothed his pillow
at night and whispered "God will take care of you
my dear, dear boy." And now as he looked into
the pale face and saw the tear-drops glisten on her
drooping lashes a fearful foreboding stole over
him, and placing an arm about her neck he sobbed:</p>

<p>"Mother, do <i>not</i> talk of leaving me! What
could your helpless boy do without you? I must
always creep about in the dust for the thoughtless
and cruel to point at, and there is nothing in the
future to hope for or look forward to. O Mother!
It is dreadful to be a <i>cripple</i> with no prospect of
being any body or doing any good to others; only
a poor, helpless boy for every passer-by to <i>pity</i>!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please do not Willie; it breaks my heart!
Remember what God has said, 'the Lord thy God
is a merciful God, He will not forsake thee, neither
destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy
fathers which he sware unto them.' I have many
times laid you, all helpless as you are, as a cheerful
testimony of my poor trembling faith at His
feet, and somehow, Willie, I have felt that he has
accepted my precious gift, and that my boy will be
ever under his especial care and love. Look up,
there is sunshine on the other side of the clouds,
and its bright beams will gild your darkness if you
will permit them to do so." The slumbering
fountain of the daughter's love was stirred at the
sight before her and bowing her head she wept!</p>

<p>"Mother," she said at last with much emotion;
"have you forgotten that <i>I</i> am his sister? Can
you not leave him to <i>my</i> care? I will never forsake
him, and all that I can do to make his life
pleasanter <i>I</i> will gladly do! Did you forget <i>me</i>
Mother?"</p>

<p>"Forget you Fanny? You were my first born&mdash;my
<i>all</i> for many years! Together we have worked
and talked, but, my daughter, you are older and
sterner by nature than my poor helpless one. He
wants companionship, sympathy in his little trials
that must ever be peculiar to himself, and no one
can do this as well as one who has suffered and
been lonely as he will always be. No Fanny, <i>you</i>
will of course be kind to him and your reward will
be sure."</p>

<p>Phebe had been an inmate of the new home for
more than three years. Happy years they had
been, notwithstanding the many trials she had
been obliged to encounter. Her foster-parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
were always kind, and it was there her heart had
first learned the luxury of loving and being loved.
How true had been the promise to her "when thy
father and thy mother forsake thee then the Lord
will take thee up!" He had taken her and she
was being fitted by his providences for the life that
was before her. A dark shadow was creeping over
her path with its sombre forebodings, and young
as she was her soul was chilled by it. She had
not noticed it before, and it was hard to realize
even now that it was so distinctly brought before
her. Of one thing, however, she was sure. Willie
was suffering and her little heart poured itself out
in words of tenderness and sympathy.</p>

<p>It was a happy day when Mr. Evans returned
from his long voyage and introduced Rover to his
new master. The shadows which had been lingering
over the home circle for two long days
suddenly vanished. Then came the long rides,
for as the father had said, "the wagon was ample
for the two," and Rover was able and willing.</p>

<p>But in the pleasant sitting-room that looked
out upon the fading lawn where the leaves were
falling from the crimson maples there were sad
talks about a coming separation, and faint, wistful
looks into the far-off future. There were smiles
and caresses that fell into "life's eventide" like
sunbeams darting through the western clouds as
night approaches. The wife and mother knew
that her days were numbered, and when the winter
storms came and mantled the hillside and
spread a pall over the lonely grave beyond the
garden where the cold marble stood, and the
winds mingled their sighs with the sobs and moans
of bereaved ones, the chamber of the slumbering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
one was entered and the loving mother slept in a
dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>A pall of gloom settled down on the inmates of
this once cheerful home! The cord that had so
long bound them all together was broken. What
would the future present to each? Where the
wisdom to choose; the firmness and strength to
battle and maintain?</p>

<p>The winds moaned and the snow came and
went; the "frost-king" fettered and unloosed;
then the spring appeared and with it changes not
only in the outward world but into the little circle
of murmuring ones. The father must go to sea;
a summer voyage was before him. It was harder
now than ever to leave his almost helpless boy
without a mother's love to comfort and cheer him;
but it must be done!</p>

<p>"I will take as good care of him as I <i>can</i>,"
Fanny remarked one evening as the father's solicitude
broke out into words.</p>

<p>"To be sure I shall have a great deal more to
attend to now, but I suppose Phebe can help me
more than she has done. She is a great stout
girl and might make herself useful if she had a
mind to do so. She ought to be made to understand
that she is dependent and should do something
to earn her own living! I cannot afford to
keep her for nothing!"</p>

<p>"This home is yours, I am fully aware, Fanny,"
replied Mr. Evans with some warmth; "and if you
wish it I will take my children out of it and find
them another." Fanny burst into tears and arose
to leave the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will endeavor to be a sister to <i>both</i> of them,"
she stopped to say in a subdued tone, and the
father was alone.</p>

<p>"I must believe her," he thought at last; "she
cannot be <i>cruel</i> to her poor brother at least!" So
in a few days, before the early flowers decked the
garden walks, the father and protector was away
upon the waves, and the home was once more
desolate!</p>

<p>Ah, there are sad times in life when even hope
seems arrayed in the sombre habiliments of mourning.
The future grows darker and darker as we
gaze upon it; there is no light because we are
powerless to penetrate the clouds that are hanging
over us. Who shall lead us out? Timid and
shrinking we stretch our trembling hands out
into the gloom when to the surprise of the fainting
heart we feel the gentle grasp of love, while
the way brightens and the faltering feet gain a
firmer tread as they step forward where the shadows
are broken and the rugged road appears in full
view.</p>

<p>If Phebe had been a <i>strange</i> child when she
entered the cottage, the intimate companionship of
the thoughtful studious cripple had not made her
less so. The events of each passing day had imparted
their impress upon her susceptible nature.
Her mind had been an open chalice into which her
foster-brother had poured the hoarded wealth of
his own; and she was learned beyond her years.
The little "dumpy figure" was now tall and well-proportioned
for her age, and Willie looked upon
her with pride and admiration. More than this,
her heart with its far-reaching mysteries had been
guided close to the cross and around it the tendrils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of its unsolved longings twined themselves. Her
dreams of the unreal were no less, but her realizations
of the sterner demands of life were more.
Willie had early learned to tell the pitying Redeemer
his tales of sorrow and deprivations, and
where he found comfort and sympathy the restless
Phebe had been led. How kind in the potter to
prepare the clay for his grand purposes of use, although
sometimes with a rough as well as masterly
hand! And how can its powers be manifested
without the "fashioning process" or its durability
secured in the absence of the "mouldings" and
the fire? The master understood his work and
Phebe lay passively in his hands.</p>

<p>Down by the lake where the wild honeysuckle
yielded up its luscious fruits to the children when
the blossoms had disappeared, was a little arbor
where tender fingers had woven the slender
branches of the whispering pines together, and in
this sweet bower Willie and his companion sat
every day when the snow and frosts were gone
and talked of the absent mother, wishing that the
gentle spirit might be ever near to check the turbulent
winds and smooth down the angry waves.</p>

<h3><a name="CRAZY_DIMIS_AND_THE_TWILIGHT_SCENE" id="CRAZY_DIMIS_AND_THE_TWILIGHT_SCENE"></a>"CRAZY DIMIS" AND THE TWILIGHT SCENE.</h3>


<p>"What are you thinking about, Phebe? I have
watched you ever since we turned the corner down
by the big pine tree, and not a muscle of your face
has moved, as far as I can discover. Tell Willie,
won't you?"</p>

<p>Phebe, thus addressed, drew herself up with a
long sigh, and passing her hand mechanically
across her forehead, replied, while her eyes remained
seemingly fixed on some far-off object:</p>

<p>"I do not know. See how the sunshine falls in
golden patches on the pond yonder, like what you
read about this morning. Willie, I <i>don't</i> want to
be <i>Phebe</i>&mdash;nothing but little Phebe. I&mdash;I want to
<i>fly</i>! See that bird going up, up. He will get
away beyond the clouds&mdash;far above the top of the
mountain yonder. <i>I</i> want to be like him, or something,
I do not know what; don't you, Willie?"</p>

<p>"Yes; though ambitions are not for one like
me; but you will be something besides 'little
Phebe,' by and by. I see it in your beaming face
and deep dark eyes; while I must always be 'poor
little Willie,' nothing else. I have for a long time
been watching you, and reading my destiny of
loneliness and utter dreariness in your strange,
mysterious words, and knew that they all came
from a heart that would never be satisfied with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
plodding life where <i>I</i> must remain. Two paths
are open to us, and I can even now see that they
must branch off from each other. O Phebe, hard
as it is to be as I am, I would not hold you, little
bird, from your upward flight; but just think what
a terrible night my future will be without my little
Phebe! Then I shall have no sweet sister to comfort
and cheer me when out of patience with myself
and cross because of my infirmity. And I shall
not be your own Willie as now. It is wrong, I
know, to feel so, but I cannot help it! It is bitter
enough to know that I must lose you, but your
love, little sister, how can I live without that?"</p>

<p>Phebe was taking a seat beside him, where he
had made room for her while speaking. And,
without answering his moan of anguish, she clasped
her arms about his neck and kissed his pale face
over and over again.</p>

<p>"Love you?" she exclaimed. "I shall always
love you. I do not believe at all in those paths
you have been telling about. What would I want
to go off in another for if you could not follow me?
No, no, Willie, I would not fly away up into the
clouds without you; or be something that I so long
to be, for I always want to be your little Phebe&mdash;nothing
else. I was only thinking while I sat here
and saw Rover draw you out of sight, how <i>I</i>
wanted to go off somewhere! and then I thought of
the <i>waves</i>&mdash;how they used to talk to me&mdash;and just
then, Willie, the patches fell down on the water,
and a strange feeling came over me; but it is gone
now, and I want to stay with you. Did not Mother
give you to me and say that I must never leave
you? You are my own Willie, just as you always
will be." And with one more kiss she took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
reins from his hand and gave the order for Rover
to proceed.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" came to them from the thicket
near where they had been sitting, and at the same
time two large, wild eyes peered through the opening
a pair of thin bony hands had made in the
thick foliage.</p>

<p>"It is Crazy Dimis; don't be afraid," said Willie,
as his companion gave a startled look; "she has
been at our house many times when I was a little
boy, and she will not hurt any one. She has escaped
from her imprisonment as she used often to
do, but they know she is harmless."</p>

<p>The figure of a woman, tall and straight, but
very plainly clad, now stood before them.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful sweet to love, isn't it silly children?
Kisses are like honey&mdash;good on the lips;
but they kill sometimes. Ha! ha! Waste them!
throw them away, silly children. They'll be bitter
by and by. It's coming&mdash;coming! Don't I
know it? Kisses are like candy, mustn't eat too
much, little fools! Beware! the roses will fade
and the thorns are sharp! They'll prick you!
Don't I know? Flowers are not for everybody&mdash;plant
cabbage! Ha! ha! Crazy, am I? <i>He</i>
said so, too. But it was the adder's tongue that
poisoned <i>my</i> life. <i>His</i> love&mdash;<i>his</i> kiss. Beware!
Remember I tell you, <i>beware</i>!" and with a bound
she darted again into the thicket and was lost from
sight.</p>

<p>Willie had taken the reins from his companion
as this unwelcome apparition appeared, but as she
vanished Phebe exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What a horrid creature! What makes her
talk so strangely? <i>Who</i> is the one she spoke of?
Do you know her?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother said she was once the brightest, prettiest
girl anywhere around; but her husband disappointed
her, and was unkind. It was this, I believe,
that made her what she is. There used to
be much good sense in what she said&mdash;shrewd,
cunning, and not wholly gibberish. But let us
hurry home; Fanny may want you."</p>

<p>"Flowers are not for everybody. Did she mean
me, Willie? Her words make me shiver!"</p>

<p>While yet speaking they came round to the
kitchen door, where Fanny met them. Something
had evidently gone wrong, for she was flushed, and
her step was quick and prophetic. She had many
cares, and her temper had not grown sweeter by
their constant pressure.</p>

<p>"You might as well have staid out the rest of
the morning, and let me do everything," was her
first exclamation. She was hurrying past, and did
not, therefore, wait for a reply.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Willie, in a low voice, as he
saw the flash of anger dart up in his companion's
eyes. "Take off Rover's harness and hasten
around to help her about the dinner, will you? I
will go and read, and perhaps think over what poor
old Dimis said until you have got through. But
promise me," he continued, playfully; "don't you
think of her or a word she said, for it is not true."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we may better do as Fanny suggested,
and go out for the rest of the morning. I wish we
could." Willie smiled and wheeled himself into the
house.</p>

<p>There were busy hands in the kitchen until
after the dinner hour that day, but no cheerful
word or kindly act were thrown in to lessen its
tediousness or lighten the irksome burdens of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
unwilling Phebe. The face upon which she looked
was cold and hard, and a sort of oppressive bustle
seemed to fill the very atmosphere. The knives
were to be scoured and the potatoes washed for the
noon meal, and her old dislike of this work had in
no degree left her since she was the "good-for-nothing
child" away in the fisherman's cot by the
sea. The departed mother had often laughed at
her aversion, and shielded her from its performance,
but not so with the thrifty Fanny. Indeed,
Phebe imagined that these were reserved for her
for the reason that she "hated" to do them, and
this morning they seemed more distasteful than
ever before. It was with no very good grace, therefore,
that she went about her task, and as she stood
by the window with the unpolished knives beside
her, she thought of her who was sleeping below
the garden wall, and wondered if "she knew what
she was doing, of her impatience and anger."
And then the crazy woman's gibberings came
back, "Flowers are not for everybody;" and "the
thorns are sharp, little fools."</p>

<p>"I hope you will get them done in time to set
the table," were the quick, sharp words that broke
in upon her reverie, and brought in her gaze from
the far-off to the labor before her. The door was
open into the sitting room, where Willie was amusing
himself with a book, and Phebe called out, "I
don't like to scour knives and wash potatoes, and I
<i>won't</i>, either. Do you remember it, Willie?" she
laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you <i>will</i>," retorted Fanny. "I'd
just like to know how you expect to get a living if
you are going to do nothing except what you want
to do. You are no better than I am, and I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
you to do this every day; so keep to work at it,
and not be looking out of the window."</p>

<p>Phebe turned, but caught sight of Willie's uplifted
hand of warning just as a bitter retort darted
to her lips, and for his sake she smothered her rage
and resumed her hated labor. She did not enjoy
any kind of work, and never hesitated to express
her dislike for it. Perhaps, had circumstances
altogether different from those that had surrounded
her brightened up each compulsory service; or a
word of love or praise been dropped now and then
over the little burdens, it would have been otherwise.
But she was a dreamer, a child with inborn
fancies, possessing a soul where poetry and beauty
reigned as twin sisters, growing and thriving upon
each other's life, but she knew it not. She was
only sure that her heart bounded in the sunshine
of genial associations, and sank with equal velocity
beneath the clouds of depressing influences.
A cold word, a frown, would fill her soul with
gloomy shadows for many hours, unless a warm
sunbeam from some loving heart came to drive it
away. Kind and cheerful as our little heroine
usually was, there lay coiled up in her nature a
demon of anger which sprang forth at every provocation
with the fury of ungoverned passion. Poor
child! It had goaded her long for one so young, and
many times she had struggled to resist its power,
but it proved stronger than her will. Love alone
can subdue such natures, while opposition only
feeds and nourishes their faults.</p>

<p>"Get out of my way!" exclaimed Fanny, as
Rover was leisurely crossing her path, while a
sudden movement of her substantial shoe gave a
new impetus to his velocity. Phebe saw it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
her heart bounded with indignation. Dropping
her work she darted forward, and throwing her
arms around the neck of the noble dog exclaimed
vehemently: "Why didn't you bite her, Rover?
she shall not kick you!" A blow from the enraged
Fanny, and a command to return to her
work silenced her for a moment, then with the
fierceness of a tiger she sprang upon her antagonist
and dealt blow after blow upon the astonished
Fanny before she had time to recover from her
surprise, or to use her powers of defence. In a
moment more, pale with anger and fright, the
child was torn from her position by superior
strength, and forced into her own little chamber
with the command "not to leave it until she received
permission." Here was a new feature in
home affairs.</p>

<p>"This child, this <i>pauper</i>, shall go where she
belongs! The poor-house is good enough for
such as she! At any rate I shall not have such a
wild-cat beneath <i>my</i> roof a great while!"</p>

<p>Willie listened to the ravings of his sister, while
his heart throbbed with unconcealed emotion.</p>

<p>"Yes, and <i>you</i> uphold her no doubt! You pity
her and think she has been greatly wronged&mdash;but
it makes no difference!"</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> think, Sister, that had you sought for love
you would have found it, and love worketh no ill
to his neighbor."</p>

<p>"Love! I <i>don't</i> want her love or <i>her</i> either!
To confess the truth I am worn out with her and
she must leave&mdash;that is all!"</p>

<p>"I know very well that you do not like to have
me advocate Phebe's cause, but did you ever
notice that her exhibitions of anger only seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to be the echo of your own? I have watched her,
Sister, with the most intense interest when laboring
under personal difficulties and perplexities,
and I have seldom seen her lose her patience
under any trial. In all the years we have spent
together she has never grieved me by an ill-tempered
word or gesture, because <i>I</i> never gave
her one."</p>

<p>"So it is all <i>me</i>, of course! I must of necessity
stand sponsor for my own sins and her's too!"</p>

<p>"No Fanny, but I would be plain. You <i>are</i>
too stern and cold, and at times unjust! You forget
that she is a child."</p>

<p>"I have heard <i>enough</i>&mdash;she must leave the
house!" So saying the enraged Fanny left the
room, the door closing behind her with a prophetic
firmness which Willie well understood.</p>

<p>Phebe sat alone in her chamber until the golden
twilight settled down upon the waters of the little
lake and tinted the tree tops that cast their long
shadows out over its bosom, and watched the
"lights and shades" which chased each other
down the hillside and over the meadow until they
rested on <i>two</i> graves just beyond the garden wall.</p>

<p>"My mother! O, my mother!" gushed up from
the overflowing heart. "Would that I were beside
you! You did not hate me&mdash;you did not make
me so wicked!" Tears choked her utterance and
blinded her vision. Hours passed and then a gentle
tap was heard on her door, but she did not
move. There had been no steps on the stairs and
well did she know who was pleading outside to
share her sorrows.</p>

<p>"Phebe, may <i>I</i> come in? It is your own Willie&mdash;come
and open the door if I may enter!" <i>That</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
voice never pleaded in vain. Now it sank down
into the wildly throbbing heart as a soft lullaby,
soothing every angry passion and illuminating
the dark chambers of her soul with the sweet
promises of peace.</p>

<p>The door was opened and Phebe returned to her
low seat by the window without a word. Willie
was soon beside her, sitting, on account of his infirmity,
at her feet; his calm blue eyes swimming
with tears were fixed intently upon her face, but
she apparently did not heed him.</p>

<p>"Will you not speak to me, Phebe? Let me
look into your eyes&mdash;there is no anger there for
<i>me</i>! Nothing but love, I am sure of it! I have
read it there so many times, but let me read it
there once more&mdash;may I not?" The arms of the
child were thrown about the suppliant's neck and
her tears fell fast as she kissed his pale cheek.</p>

<p>"I am so wicked, Willie! I wish I were good
like you and loved everybody. <i>You</i> never make
me angry, but Fanny always does. I can't help
it!"</p>

<p>"Phebe, I love you. What would my life be if
you were away? Think how long the days would
be with no one to talk to and no one to say 'I am
so sorry' when sad. In a few years at most Willie
will be out there by the side of Mother, and until
then I must creep about just as I always have
done; but I can bear it if I have you to cheer me,"
and clasping her to his heart he was not ashamed
that his tears mingled with hers.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry, Willie!" she sobbed at length.
"I heard Fanny say that 'I should not stay here.'
I did not care then, but O, I cannot leave you.
O&mdash;I will be very good! If Mother was only here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
I think I could do anything&mdash;but I am so wicked!"</p>

<p>Darkness had settled down upon the occupants
of that little chamber when Fanny called: "Willie,
<i>your</i> supper is ready! Come down immediately
and let Phebe stay where she is!" The child
darted to her feet and hastened to open the door.</p>

<p>"Fanny," she said, with a slight hesitation; "I
want to stay here, but won't you let me ask you
to forgive me? I know I am very wicked but I
will try to do better!" The stern, cold Fanny
hesitated only a moment, and then without a smile
of encouragement or a cheering caress <i>agreed</i> to
the proposition and promised to let her remain
for a while until she had tried her once more.
"Now come down to supper," she continued, "for I
am in a hurry to get my work done!" Was <i>this</i>
forgiveness? A balm to heal the wounds of injury?
Poor, sin-sick soul! Did thy heavenly
friend ever look so coldly upon thy penitence?
When did He ever pour the "gall of bitterness"
into the wounds of a humiliated heart? Small
would be the reward of "human justice" if the intercessor
did not continually stand between us and
our petition, "forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
them that trespass against us."</p>

<p>"You are a noble girl!" exclaimed Willie as
Phebe returned to her seat by the window. "I
will leave you now; you may come or stay as you
choose&mdash;all will yet be right."</p>

reared a life whose influences are to reach into the
ages that have no end. There is no living by
one's self, and the great net-work of human existence
may be warped and misshapen by <i>one</i> chilling
neglect or a palpable wrong! Even so does
the individual life often become marred beyond
remedy when it is tender and susceptible to the
guiding hand. There are natures so finely and
sensitively constituted that every rude blast twists
and bends the silver wires of the organization until
the music is dead, and the case, although polished
and beautiful to the eye, stands a wreck of what it
should have been. Such were the surroundings
of our little heroine. For fourteen years she had
been the child of "circumstances," her days filled
up with tears and laughter and her nights with
idle dreams. No mother's love had ever twined
itself about her young heart to nourish and foster
the tender plants of sweetness and purity which
was to make her life beautiful with their variegated
blossoms, or root up the entangling weeds with
which she must ever after contend. Mrs. Evans
had indeed been kind to her as the "companion of
her afflicted boy," as she would also have been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
a pet kitten or anything that would have added to
the happiness or comfort of her child. Yet she
did not fail to perceive when her vision began to
grow dim to the world that the "casket" which
had been thus opportunely cast at her feet contained
jewels which were worth securing. The
last few days and weeks of the only one whom her
heart ever claimed as <i>Mother</i> left their impress on
her soul which never faded away. It was a taste
at least of that love for which she had so often
longed&mdash;such as a child must have or be miserable!
But even that was all over now. True, Willie
had been her dear brother ever since, her
comfort when sorrows overshadowed her, her help
through scenes of trouble. But a cloud darker
and denser than any of its predecessors was spreading
itself over them both. Sad news had come to
them from over the sea&mdash;the far off dark, dark
sea. Alone they sat together in the doorway one
evening where the last rays of the setting sun
came and played about their bowed forms, caressing
their damp cheeks; but for once they were not
heeded.</p>

<p>"We are orphans now, Phebe&mdash;poor, lone <i>orphans</i>!
Never did I feel the miseries of my
decrepitude as now! I am helpless, and <i>who</i> will
take care of you? The thought doubles my sorrow!
I ought to be a man and comfort rather
than to add to your depression; but I am a weak,
helpless child, even more so, my sister, than you
to-night." Phebe raised her head from her hand
where it had been resting and fixed her large eyes
upon the pale face before her.</p>

<p>"Willie, do <i>I</i> look like a child?" she asked. "It
has not been twenty-four hours since we received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the sad news that our father had been swallowed
up by the great sea I love so well; still he is not
dead to me, but has only gone where <i>I</i> in my
childish fancy so longed to go, therefore I cannot
'make him dead;' he's only resting while he calls
upon me to act! Willie, I am no longer a child,
for every hour has seemed to add a year to my
life since that letter came! I am strong, and
thanks to you and the dear ones who have so long
sheltered me from the storms, I have a little stock
of knowledge to begin my future with; I shall act."
Her gaze had wandered off to the golden clouds
that were hanging over the little lake as she spoke,
and a look of firm resolve stole over her features.</p>

<p>"I see my fate written upon your face!" replied
Willie mournfully. "How can I endure the lonely
hours, the lengthening days? But I am ashamed
of myself. Somehow the fates have turned against
me, Phebe, and have taken away my years to add
them to yours. I will not be so childishly selfish.
But Sister, you will need a friend. How can you
go out into the world alone?"</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> a friend! Do not, I beg of you, think
me so destitute Willie. Have you forgotten Crazy
Dimis?" A low subdued laugh escaped the lips of
both at the suggestion and mingled itself with the
soft evening breeze. Suddenly they started for a
voice harsh and cold as a winter's wind was near
them which chilled the soft melody and sent it
back to their wounded hearts in a low sad wail. It
was Fanny who spoke.</p>

<p>"Your grief must have been terrible to have
been forgotten so soon!" she exclaimed. "You can
go in, Phebe, and take care of the supper table if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
you have got through crying," she continued bitterly.</p>

<p>Phebe arose without a word. For once her anger
did not rise to goad her. Could it be that her
power over this her greatest enemy had gained
strength also with her seemingly multiplied years?</p>

<p>Fanny took the seat that was just vacated by
the side of her brother.</p>

<p>"What is Phebe going to do?" was the abrupt
question.</p>

<p>"What would you like her to do? I suppose
she will be willing to be guided by your counsel."</p>

<p>"Humph! Willing! It would be the first time
that she was ever willing to do anything I wanted
her to do, and I have not the least doubt that she
would be more unwilling to accede to my wishes
at this time than ever before, for I want her to
leave the house! <i>You</i> do not need her now for
you are old enough to amuse yourself I should
think, and <i>I</i> certainly do not! There is to be a
new master here before the fall work begins, as I
suppose you know." The last remark was made
in a lower tone of voice and Willie readily understood
that she referred to her approaching marriage
with Mr. Hopkins, a young farmer living a
few miles away; but as he made no reply she continued.
"I do not suppose he would be pleased to
have <i>too</i> many incumbrances, and Phebe is old
enough and able to take care of herself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he would like to have me also vacate
his prospective premises," responded the brother
with an unnatural bitterness in his voice.</p>

<p>"O, no! He is well aware that <i>you</i> can do
nothing for yourself and has made no objections
to <i>your</i> remaining."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>There were sleepless eyes wet with weeping
that night beneath the homestead roof as the midnight
hour spread over it her dark wings, but it
bore away on its upward pinions the trusting faith&mdash;the
childlike submission of <i>one</i> heart at least to
Him who is ever a "father to the fatherless ones."</p>

<p>"Now for a long ride down by the pond and
along the sandy beach, where we can see the lilies
on the water, and if the boat is not fastened I will
gather a few for you once more," prattled Phebe,
as on the ensuing forenoon she walked by the little
wagon (which was now too small for both),
as was her usual custom when the morning's work
was done.</p>

<p>How could Willie ever forego these pleasures?
He would continue his rides, drawn by the faithful
Rover, who had seemed to enjoy these excursions
equally with his young master and mistress.
But Phebe always walked by his side, now patting
his soft coat, or gathering flowers for him who
could not skip about so blithely and easily as did
she, or now and then helping the faithful Rover
over the rough places, praising and caressing him
for his valor and strength in overcoming difficulties.
Happy trio! And was it possible that all
this must end?</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten, Willie, what my true
name is? You have not called me Lily-Pearl for
a <i>long</i> time," she remarked, as they came in sight
of the pure white blossoms that dotted the surface
of the lake. "<i>I</i> shall never forget it. See, Willie,
that beautiful lily yonder by that large leaf. How
the ripples that come sweeping around the sandbar
keep tossing it up and down, never allowing it to
be quiet a moment. O, it really makes me tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to look at it. Yet that is <i>me</i>, Willie! That is
'Lily-Pearl!' I am going to get it for you to keep.
When I am gone, and you look at it, think that I
am no more 'little Phebe,' but your own 'Lily,'
who will never forget or forsake you, my brother."
Saying this she bounded into the little open boat,
and with accustomed dexterity soon made her way to
the point designated. It was no unusual labor for
her willing hands, it being one of her greatest
amusements when the little pond was decked with
these fragrant blossoms to gather them.</p>

<p>Willie watched her for a moment, as she glided
away from him, and then his coming desolation
swept over his soul like a flood, and her form was
hidden from his sight.</p>

<p>"See, Willie, I have it!" she exclaimed, as she
held up the coveted treasure, exposing the long,
smooth stem, by which, as she said, the mother
pearl held it fast. "It came near pulling me in.
Did you see me, Willie?"</p>

<p>But he did not. See her? How could he through
all those blinding tears that came bubbling up rapidly
from his bursting heart? He had crept from
his seat in the wagon and made his way to a grassy
knoll close by, and there beneath the shade of the
old oak tree where they had often sat together he
gave free vent to his emotions. The sky was calm
and blue above him, and here and there a soft,
fleecy cloud floated through the clear sunbeams
of the July morning; the lake, beautiful in its
gorgeous frame-work of hills and woods, lay
spread out like a mirror, upon which the rays
danced and sported close to the water's edge, penetrating
the shadows, and lulling the murmur of
the leaves, throwing over the prostrate figure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the weeping boy a net-work of lights and shades
from the branches above him. Phebe had seen
him from the boat, and in a moment more was
standing beside him, her heart throbbing with
sympathy and grief. She had thought to keep
away this dark shadow for awhile by her merry
words, but it was over now; and throwing her
arms about his neck, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Willie, my dear brother, do not feel so badly.
It is true, I must go and leave you for a time, but
you are mine&mdash;all I have to love and work for.
What do I care for any but you? Yes, I must go.
I heard what Fanny said last night, but it was no
more than I have heard before, or than I expected.
Yet it makes me strong. I can leave you now, but
only for a little while. We will not be separated
long. <i>I</i> will come to you. Our mother gave you
to me, and I promised to cling to you. O Willie,
you shall see how I can work, how much I can accomplish!
I will do more than was ever done before
me by a 'cast-away.' Do you not believe me?"</p>

<p>Putting her hand under his head, she turned his
pale wet face up to her view. He did not try to
prevent her, but lay quietly as she placed him.</p>

<p>"Look into my eyes, Willie. <i>I</i> am not weeping.
It seems to me I can never shed another tear. I
feel so strong! The future, Brother! O the future!
What a great huge painting it seems! But it is
not full yet. <i>I</i> shall do something there; <i>my</i>
hands will help to color it. Yes, <i>I</i>, little Phebe."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it. There is a destiny for such
as you. A mission awaits you. I will be more
brave, more manly. You could not remain with
me. A higher position than the partnership with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
a cripple or hostler to a big mastiff is meted out to
you."</p>

<p>A smile for an instant broke over his clouded
face, and Phebe laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Give me the lily," he said, at last, reaching
out his hand for the coveted treasure. "We will
divide it. You shall have the long smooth stalk
while <i>I</i> will keep the flower. Henceforth you are
my lily, sweet and precious to me; while <i>I</i>&mdash;<i>I</i>&mdash;well,
I am nothing but the withered, crooked tendril
seeking to wind itself about your loving heart."</p>

<p>She darted from his side before the last sentence
was finished, and her companion following with his
eyes her light, buoyant figure, saw standing on an
elevation of ground not far off, the well known
form of Crazy Dimis.</p>

<p>"I have found a double blackberry," she called,
holding up something between her long, bony
thumb and finger, "come and see it."</p>

<p>Phebe went to her.</p>

<p>"Those are not double, Aunt Dimis," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Don't two make a double? Put them together
and then they do&mdash;there! It's a good omen for
you, silly child. Make them double, help the
time. We must help. Ha! ha! And help Fate!
Don't <i>I</i> know, child? Fate is waiting for you!
Go and help her make omens. But make them
good! Ha! ha! <i>I</i> didn't but I will. Silly fools.
Cry and love; by and by it will be love and cry.
Don't I now? Go back to <i>him</i>! <i>I</i> don't want you."
And with a bound she sprang over the fence and
was lost in the thick underbrush of the honeysuckle
swamp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Phebe called loudly after her but she was not
heeded. She wanted to ask her about a certain
good lady, Mrs. Ernest, for this same half-crazed
gibbering woman had awakened an interest for
Phebe in the heart of Mrs. Ernest, and it was no
idle jest when she told Willie that "Crazy Dimis"
was her friend. She now returned slowly to her
companion, who was watching her.</p>

<p>"What did that crazy creature say to you?" he
asked, somewhat impatiently. "Nothing good, I
know."</p>

<p>"Yes it was. She told me to go and help Fate.
I suppose she meant to have me fill up that picture
I was telling you about, and I must go. To-morrow
I shall start. Do not look at me so! you shall
know all&mdash;everything I do or hope to do; and I
shall come to see you often. Mrs. Ernest has
promised to help me all she can, and I think I can
make her my friend. It will be only a short run
for Rover, and you must ride over there often&mdash;as
often as you would like to hear from me, will you?"</p>

<p>She kissed his white forehead, then giving a
low shrill whistle, which the faithful dog well
understood, she said: "We must go home, for
it is time to help get dinner."</p>

<p>In a moment more Rover with his wagon came up
in good style, and they started down the path which
wound around by the meadow brook through the
clump of pine trees which stood as sentinels over
the two graves beyond the garden wall.</p>

<p>"How I wish Father were sleeping there instead
of beneath the waves," cried Willie; and no other
word was spoken. What wonder? How soon the
paths were to branch off from each other! Already
the lonely cripple felt the shadows creeping over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
him that were surely to cover his dreary pathway
as he wandered on alone. His heart was full of
these sad forebodings, and he pressed the memento
of his helplessness more closely in his hand as the
spirit of rebellion for a moment arose to goad him.
Then "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee"
came as a soft and gentle whisper to his soul, and
looking up as Rover halted by the kitchen door
he said mildly: "We shall all come together
again, Phebe."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3><a name="OUT_INTO_THE_WORLD" id="OUT_INTO_THE_WORLD"></a>OUT INTO THE WORLD.</h3>


<p>"There! That is the <i>third</i> time I have called
that girl this morning! She can lie in bed now
until she gets tired of it! It is so provoking!
And after telling her last night that I should
want her early. I am out of all patience!"</p>

<p>Willie could not suppress a smile as this volley
of indignation greeted him upon entering the
breakfast room on the morning following the
scenes related in our last chapter, although his
heart was sad, but he made no reply and Fanny
continued: "I <i>had</i> made up my mind to let her
stay a while longer; perhaps through the winter,
for after all it is hard to be sent out into the world
to earn one's own living! Besides, <i>she</i> would
never get along! No one would have patience
with her, for work she will not! And how can a
poor girl get her living if she will not work? But
it is all up now! I can't and won't support her
for nothing!" Fanny's rapid step and the brisk
rattling of the breakfast dishes kept up all the
time an active accompaniment to her words as she
continued talking while preparing their early
morning meal.</p>

<p>Willie listened to it all as he sat by the window
and looked out upon the dewy grass and took in
the soft beauties of the variegated landscape that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
lay stretched out before him, over which the first
rays of the summer sun came gently stealing,
driving back the dark shadows into the thick
woodland upon the hillside. He then opened the
window. There was music in the maple trees near
where the robins had built their nests&mdash;there was
fragrance in the cool fresh breeze that came and
fanned his troubled brow. Just outside the yard
the hay-makers stood with laughter and jest while
they whetted their glittering scythes preparatory
to their daily labor, while all the time their brown
faces wore the pleasant smile of health and contentment.
Poor Willie! He could only sit and
look at them and pray for patience and resignation.</p>

<p>A remark from Fanny recalled him, and he replied:
"I would go and call her but it would be
useless for she is not here!"</p>

<p>"Not here? What do you mean? Has she
gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she has gone, and it is my opinion Sister
that you will miss her nearly if not quite as much
as <i>I</i>."</p>

<p>"Gone! The heartless creature! This is all
the thanks one ever gets for taking care of a good-for-nothing
nobody for years! It is pretty pay
now to clear out just as she <i>might</i> have been of
some use, and without a word too!"</p>

<p>"You must have forgotten all you have been
saying to her ever since we received the sad news
of Father's death," replied Willie with some bitterness.
"Still you are mistaken; she did not leave
without a word. She has told me several times
that she was going, although I could not believe
it, and when I came out of my room I found this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
letter under my door. You can read it if you wish
when you have time."</p>

<p>Without a word she took it from his hand and
read as follows: "I cannot <i>say</i> good-bye Willie,
and so as soon as the gray dawn creeps over the
mountain top I shall steal from this house and go&mdash;God
only knows where! I came here eight
years ago a little strange child, leaving the first
real friend in all my life far behind on the road to
grieve at my absence, and now I <i>go</i> leaving only
you my brother to be sad because I am not here.
<i>You</i> will miss me; and when I think how lonely
you will be without your 'little Phebe' to talk to
I shall shed many tears. O, Willie! It is dreadful
to leave the only one who loves us to go off
alone, but I shall find friends, I know I shall! Do
not be unhappy. Tell Fanny sometime, if she <i>ever</i>
inquires as to my welfare, that I should have been
happier to-night if she had loved me, or at least
had exercised more patience with my many
faults. I know I have tried her. Somehow I am
not like the other girls about here; they are satisfied,
but <i>I</i>&mdash;yes, Willie, I want to fly&mdash;go up
among the clouds or down among the pearls&mdash;I
don't know which, but some spirit goads me on&mdash;God
only knows where. I am looking out to-night
upon the world where I am going for my
new life with more fear and trembling than when
in a little open boat I drifted away over a stormy
ocean all alone. But it is better so. A hundred
times I have shivered and shrunk before the storm
of Fanny's indignation, and as I remember it, a
peace steals over me even now with the great unknown
future before me. I did desire to do all she
asked of me, but I could not and so I must go!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Perhaps she may yet think kindly of me, who
knows? I am strong to-night dear Willie, notwithstanding
this paper has so many tear-stains
upon it! How a few days have changed me&mdash;no
longer a child but a woman going forth, as Crazy
Dimis commanded me, 'to make my fate, make
omens.' So good-bye; remember what I told you
you of Mrs. Ernest.        <span class="smcap">Phebe</span>."</p>

<p>It was finished and Fanny handed it back to
her brother without speaking. O how long that
day seemed! The sun came out hot and sultry,
drinking up the dew from the grass and withering
the soft petals of the flowers; the locust sang his
monotonous song in the shade and the mowers
went busily on with their work, and the hours
crept slowly by. Fanny was unusually silent; her
busy hands seemed never to tire, but her face all
day wore a weary, anxious look such as betokened
thought.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, just before the time
for milking, that she came and seated herself on
the lounge by her brother. Perhaps the memory
of that mother who once sat there on just such a
bright summer evening four years before came
back to her, for it was then when she told Phebe
never to leave her poor lame boy, always to love
and comfort him. Who was to blame that the
child was now an outcast, or that the poor motherless
cripple sat there in that very spot lonely and
sad? She did not speak for a moment as if ashamed
of the womanly emotion that swelled her bosom.
At last she said hurriedly: "What did Phebe
mean about Mrs. Ernest?"</p>

<p>"She has told me that I could hear about her
by going there occasionally."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why did you not go to-day?"</p>

<p>"I thought I would wait until to-morrow, then
perhaps I might hear more," was the low reply.
"She can have no definite plans as yet, but I will
go in the morning."</p>

<p>"I will harness Rover any time for you," continued
Fanny as she moved away to attend to her
evening duties.</p>

<p>Willie dropped his head upon the pillow beside
him and lay there motionless and still until the
twilight shadows came creeping in at the window,
covering him with a thick black pall. He could
have wished that night that they might have
buried him forever with their sombre folds, so
harshly did life's greatest joys contrast with his
overwhelming griefs!</p>

<p>Early the next morning Willie was on his way
to the village drawn by the faithful Rover. It
was a long time since he had been over that road
alone, and at first he felt like shrinking from the
task.</p>

<p>A carriage came and swept over the brow of
the hill, drew nearer, then passed him. A lady occupied
the back seat alone. She was a stranger
but their eyes met. Hers so full of tenderness and
pity&mdash;his bright with apprehension and suspense.
He was sure that a tear glistened in her blue eye,
but when he turned to look again she was gone.
The driver he knew. The carriage belonged to
the village hotel, and "Frank" always drove that
span of grays. Once more Willie turned to look,
and as he did so saw that the lady had bent forward
as if to speak to him. "She knows how to
sympathize with such as <i>I</i>," he thought, "for her
expression was so kindly and gentle. Those eyes&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
were so like my mother's. A deep, heavenly
look as if wishing for something she had not
yet received, which found its way into hers before
they closed forever!" and a tear dimmed his own
vision for a moment only; then his thoughts returned
to the beauties around him and to <i>her</i> he
was going perhaps to see again. The roads were
fine and Rover was in excellent spirits, so that in
a short time the village church loomed up in sight.
Close by it was the parsonage&mdash;beyond the long
row of neatly-painted dwellings surrounded with
bright green shrubbery and a pleasant lawn reaching
to the road, finally the hotel with its balconies
and lofty cupola, which overtopped the principal
business portion of the unassuming little town.
To the farther store on the main street Willie was
to go on an errand for his sister, but first of all he
would call at the parsonage. How his heart
bounded with the prospect of coming joy, then
sank again as the uncertainty rolled over him.
Where was Phebe?</p>

<p>And where was Phebe? That morning, with
her eyes full of tears she had stood in the little
chamber where she had spent so many pleasant
hours and dreamed so many pleasant dreams; the
room she must now leave, with all of its hallowed
associations, its garnered memories, to prove the
Father's unfailing promises of care and protection!</p>

<p>"You could not have forseen all this dear, dear
Mother!" she mused as she turned to the window
where the white marble stood so chill and comfortless
in the morning shadows, "or you would never
have placed your helpless boy in my care. But I
must go. This pleasant cottage is my home no
more! The flowers I have planted in the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
yonder&mdash;the bed of lilies these hands have tended
so long for <i>your</i> sake must bloom on without me."</p>

<p>The first rays of the morning sun crept up from
behind the eastern hills and rested as a sweet prophetic
peace on the tree-tops that reared their
stately heads above the lingering night shades,
and taking the letter she had written the night
previously stole softly from the room and thrust it
under the door where Willie was sleeping all unconscious
of the wretchedness that was wringing
such bitter tears from her loving heart as she
thought how he would miss her, and how lonely
would be his morning ride down by the little pond
without her. "Farewell!" she whispered, and
then descended the stairs, stopping a moment to
kiss the noble Rover and quickly passed on out in
the world! The short past with its changes, its
reachings and its longings were to be left behind,
while the broad future with its hopes, allurements
and ambitions lay before her. With a shrinking
heart but firm tread she stepped into the untried
path and walked steadily forward. Someone has
said that "the secret of true blessedness is <i>character</i>,
not condition; that happiness consists in not
<i>where</i> we are but <i>what</i> we are. Our lives resemble
much the Alpine countries, where winter is found
at the side of summer, and where it is but a step
from a garden to a glacier." Our little heroine
found this to be so. It had been summer in the
little cottage, not all sunshine nor all storms, for
the days were as ever changeful and the years
scattered over her life their shadows and their
peaceful calms. "Go help fate make omens"
Crazy Dimis had said, and with many a firm resolve
she had said to Willie, "I will do it!" There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
was a world of mysteries before her out of which
the "omens" were to be created, and little did she
understand the way in which she was to be led.
The perjured woman whose daughter had given
birth to "Lily-Pearl" had listened to the whisperings
of the serpent, and the great problem of
justice was to be worked out in the ever changing
adventures of "poor little Phebe," and now with a
satchel in her hand she had left <i>all</i> she had known
of love, and was alone upon the road where the
cool morning zephyrs petted and caressed her.
"My life!" she thought as she walked on towards
the parsonage. "If we are God's children we need
not fear the developments of His changing providences,"
Mr. Ernest had said to her one day while
speaking to him of her future, and now these
words came to her as bright and cheering as the
rays of the morning sun, for both had driven away
the darkness from her faith. Years after did
memory return to this early morn to tread again
the sandy road and listen to the chorus of the
birdling's song, or watch with palpitating heart
the silvery glories as they spread themselves over
the eastern sky; and then return to the noonday
scenes of an eventful life through which she had
been guided.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3><a name="AN_UPPER_ROOM_IN_THE_HOTEL" id="AN_UPPER_ROOM_IN_THE_HOTEL"></a>AN UPPER ROOM IN THE HOTEL.</h3>


<p>Mrs. Ernest while bustling about in her kitchen
saw her visitor approaching, and with broom in
hand came out to welcome him. He was no stranger
here, and few ever came who received a warmer
greeting.</p>

<p>"How bright and fresh you look from your early
morning ride," was the good lady's salutation, and
throwing down a piece of carpet on the damp
ground stood patting Rover and chatting merrily
all the while as Willie crept into the house.</p>

<p>"I suppose <i>I</i> am not to feel at all flattered by
this early call, for already something tells me that
Phebe is the object of your visit," she laughingly
said, while following him into the house; "so I
will turn you over to Mr. Ernest with all the indignation
I can muster," and patting him on the
shoulder she cheerily invited him to the study.</p>

<p>The occupant of the quiet room was stretched in
an attitude of languid repose upon the sofa as they
entered, but probably in deep meditation. When,
however, he discovered who had intruded into his
season of reveries, he arose with a face all beaming
with smiles, and took the little extended hand in
his own and placing an arm about his visitor lifted
him with ease into a chair close by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Ella, you may go and give Rover that
plate of chicken bones you saved for 'some hungry
dog,' for he above all others deserves it."</p>

<p>Here was a happy home.</p>

<p>"There was always sunshine at the parsonage,"
Willie would say. If clouds ever came they were
so effectually concealed that they never fell upon
another. The brightest spot on earth&mdash;the place
more to be coveted than palaces or posts of honor&mdash;is
the peaceful, happy home, the nucleus around
which fond hearts are gathered, where the compact
of love remains unbroken only as death comes
and steals away a link of the golden chain that
binds fond hearts together.</p>

<p>"Is not Phebe here?" Willie asked after a few
moments conversation.</p>

<p>"O no; she did not remain with us many
hours; but she is not far away," replied Mr. Ernest,
pleasantly. "I will tell you about her. There is
a lady boarding at the hotel, an invalid, I believe,
who has come to our village, as gossip tells us, after
health,&mdash;happiness, rather, as I believe, for she
seems very sad at times. I have called on her
often, and at one visit she expressed an earnest
wish for some one to read to her. I thought of
Phebe at once, and when she came to us yesterday
morning and told her story, of which, we were not
wholly ignorant, I thought nothing could have
been more <i>apropos</i>, and so I went over there with
her. The lady seemed much pleased, and I have
no doubt Phebe will be very happy there."</p>

<p>"I think I must have seen her when I was coming,"
interrupted Willie. "A lady passed me in
the hotel carriage who had a sad, pensive look; I
am sure it was she."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have no doubt you are right, for she rides
out every day. I wonder, however, that Phebe does
not take the opportunity to run over here for a
moment."</p>

<p>But she did not.</p>

<p>Willie stayed longer than he first intended, hoping
to see her again, but finally started for the
store on his errand, passing the place where <i>she</i>
had found her new home without even catching a
glimpse of her, although he sought diligently to
do so. Had he known that she was then engaged
in penning a long sisterly letter to him he would not
have been so thoroughly wretched all that day and
the next.</p>

<p>It was some consolation, however, that Fanny
seemed so much interested in her now that she was
away. She was minute in her inquires on his return,
yet did not appear <i>quite</i> pleased when told
that Phebe was <i>only</i> to read to her new mistress.</p>

<p>"Worse and worse," was her exclamation, "she
was good for nothing before, what will she be now?"</p>

<p>"We shall see," was Willie's quick reply.</p>

<p>But he was thinking how much he would enjoy
being there to listen as she read. He was not mistaken
in regard to his conclusions about the lady
in the carriage. It was Mrs. Gaylord, in whom
Phebe had found a friend and protector. She had
taken rooms at the hotel only a short time before,
having no other company than a young mulatto
girl about Phebe's age, who seemed devoted to her
mistress, and mild and affable to all, yet she answered
very few of the questions that were put
to her by the inquisitive.</p>

<p>"They had come from Virginny, and would go
back dare when Missus had got nuff of dis 'ere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
norf," was about the extent of the knowledge obtained
from "Tiny" on any occasion.</p>

<p>Three weeks passed away and Phebe had not
once seen "dear Willie." Mr. Ernest had told her
of his frequent visits to the parsonage, and of the
pleasure that would beam in his blue eyes as he
received her letters from him; but no amount of
persuasion could prevail upon him to make a visit
to the hotel, which was much to Phebe's disappointment.
She was always busy now. When
she was tired of reading or the lady of listening,
she was engaged with her needle.</p>

<p>"Young people are inclined to home-sickness
if not employed," Mrs. Gaylord would say, pleasantly,
and so Phebe was seldom idle.</p>

<p>During these seasons of occupation they had
talked much. Phebe had told her all she knew
about her early history, and her listener had many
times laughed heartily at the recital, but not a
word had she ever spoken of her own life. There
was a dark cloud resting upon her, it was evident,
for her companion had often looked up suddenly
from her book to see the tears falling silently from
the calm eyes, who would brush them hurriedly
away as she said "go on;" and Phebe obeyed. At
one time she smiled when detected, and drying her
eyes she said, mildly&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is jealousy, little one? You have just
been reading about it. What is <i>your</i> definition of
the word?"</p>

<p>"Willie would say 'an unjust suspicion; a sense
of imaginary wrong without proof;'" answered
Phebe, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>She laughed now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"O you little novice! How far you are behind
the times. That definition might have done for
your grandmother, but it will never do for these
modern days. I will tell you, child, what it is, or
what it means now. It is a wail of despair which
the heart gives over the loss of its dearest treasure.
The anguish of its desolation when the fire
of love burns low; the cry of woe when it sees the
vacant chair in its most secret chamber, and desolation
looks with hungry eyes out from among the
shadows of its former trysting place! Does the
poor heart murmur? Does it put on the sackcloth
and the sprinkling of ashes? Love is not
dead, but straying, <i>straying</i>! This is jealousy.
The vacation of one heart for&mdash;for&mdash;well, child,
<i>you</i> know nothing about it, and may you long remain
in ignorance."</p>

<p>She bowed her head and wept long and bitterly.</p>

<p>Phebe moved the ottoman on which she was sitting
close by the side of the agitated lady and laid
her head upon her knee. A bond of sympathy
drew them together. A chord had been touched to
which the heart of each vibrated in unison. Desolation
was creeping among the shadows in the
secret chamber of both hearts, and the feeble wail
of woe which came from the lonely hearth-stones
mingled in low, solemn cadence, and they two
were united by these bonds of sympathy. A soft,
white hand nestled lovingly among the braids of
the young girl's hair as the bowed head still rested
its heavy weight on the lady's rich dress, and from
that moment a sweet confidence took possession of
them both.</p>

<p>Ah! there is nothing so invigorating and comforting
in this ever changing life as the sweet assurance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of reciprocal affection in the hour of despondency
and gloom. A mother's kiss, a father's
fond caress, soon dries the tear and soothes the
pain of childhood, and can it be that their power
grows less towards the children of accumulated
years?</p>

<p>"Did I speak bitterly just now; my child?" the
lady asked, after a long silence. "I hope I did not
frighten you."</p>

<p>Phebe looked up into the sad face that was beaming
now with a full glory of consolation as she
answered:</p>

<p>"O no; I was not frightened. Even in my short
life I have seen sorrow, and know well what it
means. Ever since we have been together I have
believed that something troubled you, and it has
made me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Made you what, my child?"</p>

<p>"Made me love you, O may I do this? Will
you let little Phebe creep into your heart and find
a resting place there? O Mrs. Gaylord, I am so
lonely! Nobody but Willie&mdash;and he is lost to me
now."</p>

<p>The large eyes were gazing with their far-off,
mysterious look, which Willie had so often watched
with a tremor of apprehension in his heart; but
there were no tears in them. The wail was
from the secret chamber, and the lady recognized it.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">&quot;O, Mrs. Gaylord, I am so lonely.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, dear," was her answering refrain. "You
shall nestle cosily in this poor quivering heart if
you desire it. I was once a lonely orphan like
yourself, and I pined for a love I could not find.
It is dreadful&mdash;this chilling desolation of life. At
twenty I married, and was alone no longer. My
yearning heart was satisfied, not because of the
luxury that surrounded me, or the honors with
which I was crowned as the bride of the rich young
southerner. No, no. Sweeter by far than all of
this was the assurance that I was loved. That was
many years ago, when my face was fair and my
cheeks covered with bloom. It is over now, and
with my youth and beauty went the love which was
more precious than all. <i>His</i> hair has lost its glossy
hue and his step its elastic bound; but for these
my heart has suffered no reaction, yet it bears to-day
the scars of <i>many</i> wounds. Some are not yet
healed, and memory often rends them anew until
the tears <i>will</i> come trickling through the torn fissures.
But I must not grieve you, my child. The
world calls me happy, for it penetrates not the
covering that my proud spirit has thrown over all,
and I am willing it should be deceived. I came to
this quiet village to gain strength to endure; when
I have accomplished my object I shall return to
my Virginia home. It is a bright spot to the
looker on, full of plenty and repose for one whose
soul has power to take them in; and to this home,
my sweet comforter, I would take you."</p>

<p>Phebe started.</p>

<p>"Smother that refusal in those bewitching eyes,
for I shall take none of it," she laughed. "You
have just pleaded for my love. What good under
the sun will it do you when hundreds of miles are
piled up between us? No, no. We need each
other. The days we have been together have made
you a necessity to me. Do not answer me now,"
she continued, gently placing her white hand over
the lips of her companion, as she saw them move
for utterance. "Take a few more days to think
of it. We have plenty of time. Talk to me now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
about this Willie, of whom you have spoken. You
did not tell me that you loved him, but is it not so,
my child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I love him more and better than any one
else. He is a poor cripple, four years older than I,
and we have been together every day since his
father brought me to him. His mother loved us
both, and when she was about to die, she gave him
to me, and told me never to forget or forsake him.
How can I leave him to go with you? He has been
such a dear brother to me for so many years; <i>you</i>
would love him, too, I am sure, if you knew him
as well as I."</p>

<p>"How your cheeks glow, little enthusiast! Now
let me ask, is your hero drawn by a dog usually?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I was sure you must have seen him during
some of your rides for he has come to the village
often since I have been here."</p>

<p>"I have met him only twice, but even these
faint glimpses into his peaceful face takes away
my wonder at your heart's bestowal. It was pity
that caused me to notice him and long for another
beam from the liquid eyes, and now that I know
who he is I can but feel hurt that you have not invited
him to our rooms. It would do me good I
know to study that character and learn resignation
from its teachings."</p>

<p>"May I? O&mdash;you do not know how much I
thank you! I will go this very day to the parsonage,
with your permission, to tell him. He may be
there, when it is cooler, to hear from me; and <i>if</i> I
could meet him!"</p>

<p>"Did I not say that it was <i>my</i> wish to study
him for sake of the good it might do me?" and she
kissed the glowing cheek of the young girl with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
passion unusual to her. "Then go at once if you
hope to see him, but hasten back for I am too selfish
to permit you to remain long away. It is
lonely, darling, and I cannot understand how I
ever lived without you."</p>

<p>"You are so good!" and Phebe pressed the soft
caressing hand to her trembling lips.</p>

<p>Nothing is more sweet than to be guided into
this realm of thought by the precious foretaste of
the love that awaited her when the end should be
reached. She had gone out into the darkness expecting
nothing but chilliness and gloom, but instead
she was walking "by the side of still waters"
and there was freshness and beauty all along the
way. Still a portentous cloud was floating in the
clear blue of her gilded sky, for how could she
ever leave Willie to go with Mrs. Gaylord to her
southern home? The weeks were rapidly passing,
and when the hot summer days had all flitted away
there would come a change, and her life had received
so many already! "Where would the next
one take her?" As she stepped in front of the
mirror for a moment a smile of satisfaction stole
over her young face. The new hat Mrs. Gaylord
had purchased for her was very becoming, as that
lady had asserted, and she thought how it would
please Willie to see her looking so well. He had
often lamented during the last two years that it
was not in his power to procure these little luxuries,
and she went on her way with a happy heart.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_OPENING_OF_A_NEW_LIFE" id="THE_OPENING_OF_A_NEW_LIFE"></a>THE OPENING OF A NEW LIFE.</h3>


<p>"And whether we be afflicted, it is for our consolation
and salvation, which is effectual for the
enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer;
or whether we be comforted it is for our consolation;
for as all hearts suffer, all have the power
of consolation."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gaylord had suffered, and out of the sad
experience of her eventful life had come the power
to administer to others." Such was Phebe's
thought when on her way to the parsonage, which
stood in the suburbs of the village surrounded by
its fresh green lawn that had always appeared so
winning to the lovers of beauty, and peaceful to
the seeker after "consolation."</p>

<p>Mr. Ernest also knew how to bestow this gift on
the weary heart. His early days had not been
filled with the bright things that rightfully belong
to childhood, and his after years were those of toil
and strugglings. He understood well how to apply
the sympathies so consoling to those whose
feet are torn with the thorns by the way.</p>

<p>Our little pedestrian was walking away from
one minister of comfort to another who was equally
skilled, and it was with the greatest difficulty that
she could keep her airy feet down upon the well-beaten
track which ran along by the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
broad highway to the pleasant home of the village
pastor, where she hoped to find Willie and extend
to him Mrs. Gaylord's pressing invitation. Mr.
Ernest had told her that he usually came in the
early morning or in the cool of the evening, and
now the sun was fast sinking down behind the
western clouds. There might be a storm approaching,
for the breezes were fresh and cool, and she
could but think how the ripples were sweeping
around the "sand-bar" and lifting the broad lily-pads
among the rushes not far out from where the
pleasant row-boat was fastened to the old oak tree.
Should she ever glide in the little boat over the
lovely blue waters again? And then, when the
stern old winter had thrown his coverlet of ice
across its throbless bosom, when the lilies were all
asleep in their cozy beds, what delightful rides she
and Willie had enjoyed on its smooth surface as
Lloyd Hunter drew them on his large comfortable
sled. Was all this gone forever? She reached
the door, and as no one was in sight, stopped a
moment while her thoughts went on.</p>

<p>Willie was not there, for his visit had been made
in the morning.</p>

<p>"I am going by there to-morrow."</p>

<p>Phebe's eyes brightened.</p>

<p>"May <i>I</i> go with you? Mrs. Gaylord will not
let me walk so far, it not being 'lady-like,'" she
smiled. "She has invited him to our rooms, and
I am so anxious."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear; but be all ready, for I
have an engagement at nine, eight miles away."</p>

<p>There had been no need for this last suggestion,
for Phebe felt quite sure that with such a prospect
before her she could not sleep at all. Still, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
talking the matter over with Mrs. Gaylord, and
getting her consent for the proposed visit, her
heart felt a reaction at the thought of again meeting
Fanny. It seemed long since she had been
there, and the partition wall which had divided
them while still together, had not been lowered by
a single act, and now really appeared more formidable
than ever when viewed at such a distance.
How could she ever meet her?</p>

<p>When the morning sun sent his bright beams
into her window she sprang from her bed with the
question still unanswered.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Mrs. Gaylord, putting
her head in at the door at that very moment.</p>

<p>Phebe was surprised. Seldom did the lady leave
her room before all of the rest had breakfasted.</p>

<p>"O, you needn't look so wonderingly at me,"
she continued, laughing. "I only thought I would
tell you to put on your new white dress, as it is
such a lovely morning, and then I want you to
appear your best, for I know <i>he</i> will appreciate it,"
and she was gone.</p>

<p>"Well does she know how to be a comforter,"
thought Phebe.</p>

<p>How well she remembered at that moment the
last walk she had with Willie down by the little
pond, and his mournful wail of desolation as they
talked of his lonely future without her!</p>

<p>The bell sounded along the hall telling all who
desired an early breakfast that it was now ready,
so hastening with her toilet, she opened the door
leading to Mrs. Gaylord's room, and to her surprise
found her also ready to go with her.</p>

<p>"I have had a new thought," she said gaily,
"and have ordered the carriage. We will go together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and take him out for a little airing. Rover,
I have no doubt, will be much obliged to be excused
for one day. Two miles and a half is a pretty
long road for such a brute to draw so heavy a
load."</p>

<p>Phebe made no answer, for she was a little disappointed.
She had anticipated the walk back and
the uninterrupted talk more than she had herself
been aware of.</p>

<p>"Do you not like my arrangement?" queried the
lady, artlessly.</p>

<p>Phebe expressed much pleasure at the prospect,
and, come to think of it, "the new plan was preferable,
as it would take away all embarrassment in
the meeting with Fanny."</p>

<p>The carriage was at the door when the two were
ready, and in a few minutes they halted before the
parsonage to report the change. Then away they
rolled on their delicate errand of pleasure and
comfort.</p>

<p>Never had Phebe looked so fresh and pretty as
now. Her plain hat of white straw sat jauntily on
her heavy braids of jetty hair, from beneath which
her dark eyes shone with a new brilliancy, her
dress, about which Mrs. Gaylord had been so particular,
set off her well rounded form to the best
advantage, and as she sat by the richly attired
lady no one would have imagined that the two
were mistress and menial. Some such thoughts
must have passed through the mind of the young
girl, for her cheeks glowed, and an air of worth if
not superiority, sat with easy dignity upon her
every movement.</p>

<p>"There he is," she exclaimed, as they came in
sight of the white cottage among the maples. "He
is waiting for us."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurry Frank," said the lady, "he does not yet
recognize you Phebe."</p>

<p>"Willie, dear brother Willie!" she called out as
the carriage drew up before the gate, and in a
moment she had darted down by his side, and
throwing her arms around his neck said cheerily:
"Come, Willie, Mrs. Gaylord wants to take you
out for a ride! It is lovely, and Rover can have a
rest!" His face crimsoned as he realized that
strangers were witnessing their joyful meeting.
Unperceived Mrs. Gaylord had approached, and
holding out her hand said pleasantly: "Phebe
was so selfish that she was going to have you all
to herself but I concluded to defeat her plans.
Will you be so kind as to go with us and spend
the day at our rooms? We will try to make it
very pleasant for you." All this was said with so
much tenderness that it would have been impossible
for the poor boy to refuse.</p>

<p>"Let me get your hat, for I see that you are all
ready as usual," and Phebe forgetting her dread
of the "frigid Fanny" rushed into the house,
meeting that important personage on the very
threshold.</p>

<p>"Good morning" was her cheerful salutation;
"we are going to take Willie away from you for a
few hours, and I have come for his hat."</p>

<p>"He has not been to breakfast yet," was the
chilling reply. "I think you had better wait and
give him time to eat."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be better," ejaculated Phebe
as she passed her, hat in hand.</p>

<p>"In the meantime would you not like to go
with me down our pleasant walk to the pond?"
asked Phebe, as she came back where Mrs. Gaylord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and Willie were conversing familiarly. The
lady cheerfully consented and they were soon out
of sight among the trees that skirted the meadow
brook. When they returned, Willie was sitting
by the side of Frank and his usually pale face was
flushed with excitement.</p>

<p>"If you like we will go around by the old town
road," said the driver as the rest of his company
became seated. "It will be two miles farther back
but it is cool and shady." "All right!" and the
happy trio were rapidly borne away. Phebe had
told her friend how her "dear brother" became so
helpless and his sensitiveness in regard to it, and
had more than once seen the tears of sympathy
glisten in the fine eyes of the listener at the narration.</p>

<p>"His feet and limbs below the knees have not
grown since he was a baby," she had said; "and
of course they cannot bear the body, which is well
developed. He can creep about very well, but is
unwilling that any one outside of his own home
should see him. When a mere child he has told
me his manner of locomotion was to sit and <i>hitch</i>
himself about, which gave him the appellation
among the boys of 'hitch Evans' which so mortified
his pride that he would not appear among
them."</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" was the low response. Now, however,
Mrs. Gaylord chatted pleasantly with him
about the beauties of the landscape&mdash;the fading
glories of the passing summer and of her own
home in the sunny south, until as he said after, "I
forgot that I was a mere cypher amid it all."
At last they arrived at the hotel, and as Frank
with his strong arms set him on the broad winding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
stairway he scrambled up to the top on his hands
and knees, laughing as he did so because Phebe
would wait for his slow movements rather than
trip forward with Mrs. Gaylord, who wanted to see
if Tiny had all things in readiness.</p>

<p>It was a delightful day to them all. Dinner
was served in the upper room, and Phebe thought
as she watched the glowing face of her brother that
it was never before half so beautiful as now. Was
it because Phebe was again near him? Or had
the kind words and suggestions of his new friend
aroused energies of which before he was not conscious?
It was true that every moment had been
filled with reading and conversation and it was all
so new to Willie! "It is a fact," continued Mrs.
Gaylord after Tiny had taken off the last dish
from the table; "that many with far less brains
and more inefficient than yourself have filled important
places in the world's history. With exercise
I do not see why your body should not become
sturdy and robust. I have a friend in Boston who
has a large clothing store and manufactures his
own goods, and the great object of insisting upon
your company to-day was to tell you that I will, if
you desire it, bring your case to his notice, and if
he favors my suggestions will let you know all
about it."</p>

<p>"O&mdash;if I could!" came from his overflowing
heart. "If I could only do something! I have
always been told that it was no use for me to exert
myself for I was helpless, and I had settled down
as far as it was possible on that supposition."</p>

<p>"But you are not! Your present skill with the
needle has its advantages and in a very short time
you would be independent at least. Labor brings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
contentment and with it the years would not pass
so laggardly." Phebe had come up behind him
and was smoothing his brown curls with her gentle
hand, and reaching up his trembling one he
clasped hers tightly as he asked:</p>

<p>"Phebe, more than sister, can I do this? Will
the time ever come when I shall cease to eat the
bread of dependence? Tell me Phebe, for your
words have ever given me strength; am I truly
only the long withered stalk you hold as the emblem
of myself?"</p>

<p>"No, Willie! Believe what Mrs. Gaylord has
said and grow firm! You can&mdash;you will! I feel
it in my heart you 'will go up the stairs' and
leave some at the foot who do not now expect to
stay there! I thought of it to-day and determined
not to let you go ahead of me, and so kept close
by your side." She laughed while he warmly
pressed the hand he had been holding.</p>

<p>"You see," interposed Mrs. Gaylord, "Phebe
and I have talked a little about this but I did not
mention, even to her, the plans which for more
than two weeks I have been maturing. To-morrow
we will go to the city, Phebe and I, and see
what can be done, and if you will come to us on
the following day all can be decided."</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> decided! Mr. Bancroft of Boston would
do well by him; take him into his own home and
see that his wants were attended to until he had
become efficient in the business, and then give him
a place in his establishment if he proved himself
worthy.</p>

<p>"Worthy?" exclaimed Phebe; "he is noble&mdash;he
will be all you can desire!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"The hearts of young ladies are not always reliable
in <i>business</i> relations," replied the gentleman
with a mischievous twinkle in his bright eye.
"However, Mrs. Gaylord, upon your maturer judgment
I will try him, for really you have excited
in me an interest for the young man; and I see no
reason why he cannot be a master workman. <i>I</i>
began life by coiling my feet under me on the
bench, and I could have done it just as well had
they not been incased in No. 9's." He laughed.
"His Rover will be just the thing; he can soon be
taught to bring his master to his work and return
to his kennel for protection. And by the way, I
shall be obliged to see that <i>his</i> animal has an
'ordinance' of its own. They kill dogs here so
promiscuously."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> had thought of that and concluded to set
Pompy at work training another for his use as
soon as I return home. You know he is famous at
such work."</p>

<p>Willie received the report of their successful
mission in the city with almost ecstatic joy. "Can
it be true?" he thought. There would be difficulties;
any amount of pride must be overcome&mdash;shrinking
sensitiveness subdued&mdash;but he would
try! To have aspirations&mdash;anticipations of success&mdash;what
more could he desire?</p>

<p>In three days Mrs. Gaylord would go with Willie
to his new home and Phebe was to accompany
them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3><a name="ROSEDALE" id="ROSEDALE"></a>"ROSEDALE."</h3>


<p>Come with me, gentle reader, to the sunny south,
to the land of orange groves, where the air is
sweetest and the sky is bluest; where nature's lyre
does not of necessity get unstrung or lose her
summer melodies as winter breaks in with harsh,
discordant notes to jar the ear and chill the rich,
warm blood. Come to the land of flowers, of poetry,
of dreams. Hard seems the fate which thrusts
a "serpent into every paradise," in whose trail
death follows, withering up its freshness and
throwing a net-work of decay over its richest beauties.
Yet such is the intruder blighting many
homes in the cold regions of the bustling north,
as well as in the clime where the sweet singers of
the faded woods delight to pour out their winter's
songs. Alas! that it should be so.</p>

<p>"Why, my Lily-Bell, how faded you look this
morning! Worse than the rose you wore in your
hair last night. Now let me wager something.
What shall it be? Ah! my yesterday's letter
against your's of yesterday, also, that I can divine
the cause. Shall it be? Ah! that smile! It was
like the morning zephyrs sporting with the withered
petals of my 'Lily-Bell.' Let me kiss back
its beauty, or breath some of my exuberance into
it, which seems so worthless in its prodigality," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the lively little lady bent over the invalid's chair
and kissed over and over again the brow of her
companion.</p>

<p>"There! there! Look quickly! Two little
rose leaves of unquestionably pinkish hue are fluttering
in close proximity to those lovely dimples.
But they have flitted away again. What a pity
that beauty is so fleeting."</p>

<p>"I should think you would despair, dear Grace,
of charming one into life who has been so long
dead. The task would be more congenial to your
taste, I imagine, to roll me up and lay me away in
your casket of precious relics for memory to grow
sentimental over in future years. Why do you
not do it, <i>la Petite</i>? Own that you are weary, as
the rest do, and thrust me out of sight."</p>

<p>"No, indeed; I have no passion for musty relics.
Come, let us away to the drawing-room. It is nearly
time for breakfast."</p>

<p>"Are you aware, cousin mine, of the compliments
you have been showering upon me, 'fading,
withering,' etc.? To tell the truth, I am quite unwilling,
under their pressure, to appear before our
brilliant guests, understanding now the full array
of blemishes of which I am the possessor."</p>

<p>"I was only prattling, Lily-Bell. Nothing human
could be purer or sweeter than that face of
yours. Let me picture it," and kneeling on the
carpet before her companion, she took a little white
hand and pressed it lovingly in her own.</p>

<p>"No, no; do not call me silly. There, keep
that smile. That little mouth was just made for
such glowing sunbeams to play about. How I
would like to tear away those lines of sadness
which so mar its exquisite formation, and bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
back the soft tints to those lips. Not that it would
enhance its perfection, but it would denote health
of body and heart. Then those eyes, so dark,
deep and fathomless! I cannot look into their
depths without a feeling of purity and holiness
stealing into my soul, as though I had taken a
peep into the land of spirits where there is no sin.
What, a tear? Forgive me, darling. I should
have known better. I too often pelt the door of
your heart's sepulcher with the pebbles of my
thoughtless volubility. Thank you for that look
of forgiveness. Now let me depart before I sin
again. But, just a moment. Whenever I plant
my tripping feet on sacred ground, bid me hush,
begone. Check me, dearest. I want to be your
sunbeam, not the east wind that blows up dark
clouds; will you?"</p>

<p>"I will let you act and talk naturally. I like it.
If at times you discover tears, it need not frighten
or silence you. They seem as necessary to my
existence as the rain to the summer flowers. Now
begone; <i>I</i> shall go out among the zephyrs awhile
that they may freshen up these 'withered petals.'
Do not mention me below. Good bye," and Lillian,
kissing her hand to her companion, glided through
the open door and away out of sight.</p>

<p>At the time of which I write there could not be
found in all Georgia a more charming home retreat
from the cares and tumults of the bustling world
than the home of the Belmont's.</p>

<p>"Rosedale" was what its name would seem to
designate, a garden of roses. The house was built
around three sides of a hollow square in the center
of which a fountain sent up its sparkling jets
above the cool twinkling shadows of the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
which surrounded it, up into the sunlight, catching
its rainbow tints and falling back into the marble
basin beneath, with a cool trickling sound that
charmed the weary and enervated into quiet and
repose, lulling the restless spirit into dreams of
future peace and rest. The open side looked towards
the north, and as far as the eye could reach
the most charming landscape was extended. A
thoroughly cultivated cotton field was near by, but
it wound around to the right and was lost sight of
behind the orange grove. On the left the white
rude huts of the negroes were just discernable. On&mdash;on,
the distant hills kept rising, over which the
blue sky seemed to hover lovingly, giving to the
bright green fields a darker hue, and to the little
busy river below the terrace, a robe of its own soft
color.</p>

<p>The constructor of this beautiful home had been
sleeping for many years where the fir trees nestled
together and the purling river sang all day its rippling
song as if to hush to more silent repose the
quiet slumberer. The widow, however, who had
never laid aside her weeds, had well maintained
her position. There was no plantation in all that
region more thrifty or prosperous than this. It
was a pleasure to visit Rosedale, particularly now,
as Charles, the only son, had returned from his
European tour as reputed heir and proprietor of
the beautiful estate, and of course the spacious
drawing-rooms were crowded.</p>

<p>One hour after Lillian had left her chamber she
was sitting alone in a quiet summer house at the
foot of the terrace looking dreamily out upon the
landscape, listlessly plucking the roses which
drooped about her and scattering their bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
petals on the ground at her feet. Perhaps she
imagined who would look for her there at that
hour, still when the sound of a footstep fell on her
ear she started and her pale cheek flushed for a
moment; but when George St. Clair entered she
smiled and extended her hand in welcome. He
took it tenderly in his own and seated himself at
her feet.</p>

<p>"You have carpeted the ground for me with
rose leaves which these little hands have wantonly
spoiled," he said with his usual gallantry. "O,
Lillian, how cruel you are!"</p>

<p>"Do not George; I want to talk with you! I
have spent a sleepless night trying to summon
sufficient resolution for this interview. I feel that
you deserve some share of my confidence at least,
and it is sweet to know that after all this struggling
I can give it to you."</p>

<p>"And I shall be glad to receive it, although I
have a presentiment that it is my death doom!"</p>

<p>She bowed her head and her white lips touched
his forehead. "I love you, George, with the
purest sisterly affection, and in my poor heart
your sorrows will ever find a sympathetic response.
I feel that I shall give you pain by what I must say,
and God knows how gladly I would save you from
it if it was in my power. But bear with me; I
have long loved another! You have surmised it&mdash;<i>I</i>
now confess it! I was not yet fifteen when I
met and loved Pearl Hamilton. You remember
the time I went north to school? He was a Philadelphian
by birth and a nobler, truer heart never
beat! Could you see him George you would not
blame me for what I did! I was a child&mdash;a petted,
spoiled child! My wishes had never been disputed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and why should they be then? In a very
few weeks I became his wife. Do not look at me
so wildly! It is <i>all</i> true&mdash;<i>I am a wife!</i>"</p>

<p>"Lillian, <i>why</i> have you deceived the world and
me so long? Why did you not tell me this three
years ago when I returned from Europe? Had
you done so I would have spared you all of the
torment my repeated proffers of love must have
caused; and it might have been had I known the
truth at that time less bitter for me to-day. But
I will not chide you." The young man had risen
to his feet while speaking and paced to and fro the
full length of the arbor.</p>

<p>"Come and sit by me," she pleaded; "I have
not yet finished." He obeyed. "It was not <i>my</i>
fault, George, that you did not know all at the
time, but let me continue my narrative. It will
not detain you long. I was married, not however
without the approbation of my aunt, with whom I
resided. As soon as it was over a sudden fear took
possession of me. I did not dare tell my mother.
For the first time in all my life I had acted without
her approval, and now I was fearful of her
displeasure. It came at last. After much persuasion
from my husband and friends I told her all.
One bright day when Pearl was absent from home
my aunt sent for me. I obeyed the summons, and
there met my mother after a separation of more
than a year. Her greeting was cold, her manner
stern and commanding. It seems that she had
been in the city three days, and during that time
had accumulated legal documents sufficient to
prove to <i>me</i>, at least, that as neither of us was of
age our marriage was null and void. Her words
overpowered me. But I will not picture the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
that followed. I was a <i>child</i> again obedient to her
will. We left the city before the return of my
husband, and I have never seen him since. I have
written many letters, but have received none in return.
Only <i>once</i> have I heard that he yet lived.
My aunt wrote that he stood very high in the estimation
of the people and remained true to his boyish
vows. That letter was not intended for my
eyes, but they saw it, and my heart responded to
his fidelity. Thus to-day you find me what I am.
Now, tell me, George, do you hate me for what I
have done? I had not the power to break away
from the injunction laid upon me. My mother said
that in time I would not only regret but forget,
my folly, and would thank her for placing me in a
position to marry some one equal to myself. O
George, think of these long years I have carried
this aching, desolate heart. My whole being has
seemed enervated. But this fresh proffer of your
love has aroused me. I <i>am</i> a <i>woman</i>, and there is
<i>injustice</i> in all this. <i>You</i> are good and noble; for
this reason I have confided in you, breathed into
your ear words that were never before spoke by
me."</p>

<p>"Thank you! But, Lillian, what proof has your
aunt that <i>he</i> remains true to his early vows? Do
you think <i>any</i> earthly power could keep <i>me</i> from
you were you <i>my</i> wife? And yet you tell me that
you have not received one answer to your many
letters."</p>

<p>"Did I not also tell you that there was <i>injustice</i>
in all this? And more&mdash;I am fully convinced that
there has been and <i>now is</i> a <i>criminal</i> wrong being
enacted of which <i>I</i> am the subject."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"It <i>cannot</i> be! O Lillian! henceforth I am
your friend and your brother. Command me at
all times, and I am your obedient servant. Henceforth
my country only shall be my bride. I will
wed her with good faith. I will suffer, I will die
for her. But you will be my sister, Lillian. Call
me <i>Brother</i>. Let that appellation, at least, fall
from those sweet lips like the refreshing dew, for
I feel that my heart is withering, and then I must
go. I came to bid you farewell. New duties are
calling me, and I am glad that it is so."</p>

<p>"God bless you, my brother," came like low,
plaintiff music to his ear.</p>

<p>For one moment he held her close to his heart,
and gazed into the beautiful eyes where a world of
love and suffering lay hidden; then imprinting a
kiss upon her fair cheek fled from her presence.
He was gone.</p>

<p>For a long time Lillian sat like one in a dream.
Could it be? Had the friend of so many years
really spoken the last farewell? How much she
had prized his love; his demonstrations of tenderness;
and now they were to be hers no more. How
much it had cost her to sever this sparkling chain
of gold which the heart of woman ever covets,
God only knows. But the work had been accomplished
at last, and the thought brought more of
relief with it than pain after all. She had pondered
it so long and shrank from its performance
until the burden of her coming duty pressed heavily
upon her; but it was lifted now, and a sense of
peace stole into her mind as she realized the truth.
Then there came a wave of apprehension that suddenly
dashed its murky waters over her. "What
would her mother say?" She had so long been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the submissive <i>child</i> in her strength and power
that it was a marvel <i>how</i> she had dared to loosen
herself from them or act for once upon her own
responsibility. There was one reason why that
mother had so insisted upon her wedding George
St. Clair, but the daughter had never been able to
obtain it from her.</p>

<p>"But I could <i>not</i>&mdash;O I could not," she exclaimed,
rising and standing in the door way of the arbor
as she looked away down the road where her lover
had ridden at full speed, taking with him, as she
well knew, an aching heart, but one not more
wretched than her own.</p>

<p>Raphael made the transfiguration a subject for
his pencil, but died before it was finished, and how
many of us will do the same? We begin life with
glowing tints, but the sombre colors are demanded.
We lay aside the brush as incapable of the task,
and other hands interfere to spoil its designs or
destroy the first intention altogether. Lillian's
life had opened with a few glowing outlines, but a
masterly hand had changed the subject, and the
canvas was yet to receive its filling up, and God
was marking the designs upon it for her; and,
discovering this, she bowed her head with reverential
awe before the solemn realization, and with a
firmer and steadier step than had been hers for
years, she walked to the house and entered her
own room.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he&mdash;he! Didn't Massa George make Spit-fire
fly, tho'? Gorry! 'specks them bobolishenis
'll have to take it now, no 'stake. He&mdash;he&mdash;he!"</p>

<p>"O you get out. What you talk 'bout bobolishenis

with the air of one who did understand and utterly
despised one who was not as fortunate as herself,
as the toss of her lofty turban perfectly demonstrated.</p>

<p>"'Specks old woman, ye'd jus' like to know all
what dis nig' duz. 'Mighty smart! He&mdash;he&mdash;he!
Gals ain't 'speeted to know nothin' no how," and
Pete, who was the especial favorite of his young
master, turned away from his unappreciative auditor
with all the dignity supposed to have been
handed over to him with the last suit of young
massa's cast-off clothing in which he was pompously
arrayed.</p>

<p>Just then the soft folds of a white dress peeped
out from behind the foliage of the "Prairie Queen,"
which scrambled about in native abandonment
everywhere over the corridor on one side of the
moss-covered terrace. Pete saw it as it waved in
the noonday breeze, which was scarcely sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to move a leaf or flower, so stealthily it came ladened
with its burden of perfume. Discovering that
some one was so near, the astonished slave was
about to retreat in much confusion, when Grace
Stanley stepped from behind the massive vine and
stood before him.</p>

<p>Evidently there had been tears in her brilliant
eyes that were unused to weeping, but they had
succeeded only in leaving transparent shadows
over their brightness. Sad traces, to be sure, of
what had been, as well as presentiments of what
might be. Her soft cheek wore a deeper tint than
was usual to it, and her long lashes drooped lower,
casting a sombre shade beneath them, and that was
all. Yet the little heart, all unused to sorrow,
throbbed beneath the pure white bodice with a
wound it seemingly had not the power to bind up.
She had come to Rosedale as free and joyous as
the birds that flitted among the orange blossoms
where the zephyrs were then gathering their sweets,
and the future over which her feet would gladly
tread decked with the brightest and sweetest flowers,
among which the trailing serpent had never
for a moment showed his treacherous head; but
she had found that the blossom of hope will wither
and the golden sunshine fade; and this consciousness
had pierced her sensitive nature as a cruel
dart, and the pain had made her cheek tear-stained
and brought shadows of disappointment. She had
met George St. Clair two years before her present
visit, and thought him the most noble and true of
all his sex, and who can tell of the dreams that
came uninvited into her nightly visions as well as
in her peaceful day reveries? Can you, gentle
reader? There comes a day to us all when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
kaleidoscope of every heart's experience gives a
sudden turn as it presents to view more complex
minglings of brilliant colors and perplexing designs
than has ever been seen in any previous
whirl, weird fancies through which we are all
looking.</p>

<p>Grace Stanley had been watching their ever
changing glow until the brilliant tints had
imprinted their rosy hues over every hope and
promise of her life; but on this very morning
there had been another turn, and the sombre shades
were now uppermost. He loved "Lily-Bell," and
had flown from her presence a rejected lover, but
without one word of farewell to her. "My country
shall henceforth be my bride," she had heard
him say, and who could tell what the terrible war
might bring to them all. He was gone, and this
fact alone was sufficient to sadden her future, still
"no one shall know it," she thought as she walked
across the garden and stepped upon the moss-covered
terrace. "This hour shall be covered from
sight forever, even from myself." She had grown
calm as she stood there listening to the conversation
just outside, and with a faint smile flitting
among the sombre tints of sadness that were retreating
from her pretty face, she bluntly asked
the bewildered Pete&mdash;</p>

<p>"What did I hear you say about Master George?"</p>

<p>She had drawn more closely the thick veil of indifference,
and suddenly her face was wreathed in
smiles as she stood there looking into the dark,
perplexed visage of the scared negro boy; just as
flowers will grow and thrive in beauty on the
graves where our idols lie buried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"O nothin', Miss Grace&mdash;nothin', nothin' at all.
But he did make Spit-fire look buful, sartin, sure.
<i>Gorry!</i> didn't she <i>go</i>, tho'? Dat's all, Miss Grace,
sure dat's all."</p>

<p>"I thought I heard you say something about
his going to shoot the abolitionists, Pete, was I
mistaken? Do you know what they are?"</p>

<p>"Don't know nothin', Miss Grace, sartin. 'Spects
dey be somethin' what hunts a nigger mighty
sharp, 'cause I heard Massa Charles say he'll pop
'em over&mdash;dat's all, young missus, sartin, sure,
dat's all."</p>

<p>"Well, Pete, let me tell you something. In my
opinion you will be wiser than you are now, and
that before many years; only keep your eyes
open."</p>

<p>"Neber you mind, Miss Gracy. Dis nig' 'll
keep his eyes peeled, dat's what he will."</p>

<p>Grace Stanley passed leisurely into the hall
which ran through the main building leading to
the open court beyond where the fountain was
throwing its cool, sparkling jets into the sunshine.
She did not heed it, however, but passed on up the
broad winding stairway, meeting no one on the
way as she ascended to the hall above. The sun
had nearly reached his meridian glory, and the
oppressive heat had as usual driven the inmates of
that elegant home to their shaded retreats, where in
comfortable deshabille they lounged on beds and
sofas drawn up by the open windows, that perchance
they might catch some stray breeze that
would flit up from the orange groves or come from
the woodland far away on the hill side.</p>

<p>"Grace," called a sweet voice through the half-open
door of Lillian's room, "I thought it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
your light step I heard on the stairs. Come in
here, darling. See how nice and cool it is." Grace
obeyed, but Lillian did not notice the sombre shadows
that were playing over the usually sunny face
of her cousin, so absorbed was she with the hovering
glooms that had fallen from her own passing
clouds, and so she continued, pleasantly: "Perhaps
you would like to make yourself a little more
comfortable? Put on this wrapper, dear, and then
come and sit by me, will you? I want to talk a
little."</p>

<p>This was just what her companion did not care
to do; still, remembering that her mission to Rosedale
was to cheer by her lively mirth and vivacity
her drooping cousin, she hastened to obey. Yet
how was she to accomplish her task? Only three
weeks had passed since her arrival, yet weeks so
heavy with their weight of circumstance that her
very soul seemed pressed down beneath their
weight. Where now was her native joyousness?
The cheering powers she was expected to impart
to others? She must recall them. Yet she was
chilled and oppressed; what was she to do? Act.
Her retreating volubility could only be summoned
again to its post through action, and it <i>must</i> be
done!</p>

<p>"What a sweet little bouquet," she exclaimed,
arousing herself to her work. "A delicate spray
of jesamine, a few tiny rose-buds and geranium
leaves. Do you know that I never could have
done that? There is something so exquisite in
their arrangement. Somehow as a whole they
send an impressive appeal to the inner senses, my
'Lily Bell.' There must be such a bubbling
fountain of poesy in a soul like yours. Teach me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
dear cousin, to be like you." And the pensive
speaker dropped upon the floor at the feet of Lillian,
where she most delighted to sit, and drooping
her head wearily upon her companion's knee.</p>

<p>Both were silent. One heart had that morning
drawn back the rusty bolt on the door of its inner
chamber and rejoiced to find itself strong enough
to drive out at last, its long imprisoned secret of
gloom that had made it so wretched through the
revolving changes of many years, while the other
was even then busy with the fastenings of the secret
closet where the unsightly skeleton of her lost
love was to be hidden from the world, from herself.
Yet so doing might eat the bloom from her cheek
and the joy from her buoyant nature. Why did
she wish to be like Lillian? She had not asked
even her aching heart this question, but all unconsciously
to herself a response came up from the
hidden recesses of her soul where a fresh grave
had been dug by trembling hands and into it a dead
hope had been lowered and closely covered, while
the damp earth was trodden down hard about it,
and the low whisper said, "If like her, this poor
heart to-day would not be draped with its sombre
emblems of bereavement." To be as she was, to
possess the power to win. O the poor throbbing
hearts all over the world that must keep on through
the years with their wounds and pains, for in them
are many graves hidden away among the cypress
shades, where the passer-by can never spy them
out; but the eye of the eternal one sees them all,
and at every burial the tear of sympathy mingles
with the liquid drops of bereavement that must fall
on the stone at the mouth of the sepulcher which
by and by will be rolled away at His command.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Lillian aroused herself after a long silence.</p>

<p>"You give me more praise, darling, than I deserve,"
she said. "I am as incapable as yourself
in performing these little touches of the fine arts
which you see every day on my table. Black
Tezzie can alone teach you the mysteries of a skill
she so fortunately possesses. Do not look so incredulous,
or I shall be obliged to prove it to you,"
she smiled.</p>

<p>"I am not unbelieving, sweet Lily-Bell," she answered,
"but I confess that you have surprised
me. I should sooner have suspected either of the
other servants of such a gift as that ungainly
biped," Grace laughed, but Lillian remained silent.</p>

<p>"This only proves that it is sometimes impossible
to read the soul from the outside, my pretty
cousin. I learned long ago that there was more
beauty and a brighter reflection of heavenly glory
shut up in that ebony casket, so unprepossessing
in its general make-up, than in half the more
graceful and elegant ones. But perhaps you are
among the number who believe that these dark
forms we see every day have no souls within
them?"</p>

<p>"Why, Lily-Bell! what a suspicion. Still, how
am I supposed to have any knowledge regarding
the matter, seeing I have never dissected one of
them?"</p>

<p>A gesture of impatience followed this remark,
but her companion did not appear to notice it, for
she continued:</p>

<p>"I believe that old auntie has as pure and white
a soul as ever inhabited an earthly tenement. I
have laid my head on her bosom with a deeper
sense of rest than it was possible for me to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
elsewhere. Her prayers that have gone up so continually
for 'de poor wee lamb' have imparted
more real comfort and hope to this tempest-tossed
soul of mine than any that could have ascended from
consecrated temples. No soul? What could I ever
have done without her in this life? And my anticipations
regarding the brighter one to follow are
stronger to-day because of her."</p>

<p>Grace Stanley arose from her seat and walked to
the window, while her companion did not fail to
perceive that a cloud had risen and was spreading
itself over her features. Not wishing to press the
subject further, she remarked calmly:</p>

<p>"Some of our company are leaving to-day, and
George St. Clair wished me to hand over to you his
adieus, as he departed in great haste, regretting
the fact that he was not able to meet you again."</p>

<p>At the first sound of her voice Grace had returned
to her seat upon the carpet, and Lillian,
taking the sweet face between her little hands,
gazed tenderly into it, as she continued:</p>

<p>"You will pardon me, darling cousin, I know,
but did you not hear our conversation in the rose
arbor, at the foot of the lower terrace, two hours
ago?"</p>

<p>The dimples stole out of the cheeks the soft,
white hands of the interrogator was pressing so
lovingly, and the light joyousness in her bright,
sparkling eyes became dimmed, while a veil of
crimson spread itself over it all. The head bowed
low as it released itself from its imprisonment, and
tears that had long been struggling to be free came
now unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>"I do not chide you, darling; I knew you were
not far away, for I had espied a portion of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
white dress fluttering through a crevice of the vine
outside of the trestle-work, and rejoiced that it
was so."</p>

<p>"I would not have remained, Lillian, had not
my dress become so entangled that I could not
loosen it without revealing my presence. Believe
me, cousin, I was not a willing listener. You will
not doubt this?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; and, darling, let me assure you
that my heart is lighter for the circumstance, for
we are confidants now. I have had such a longing
to tell you all; but this one secret had become
habitual to me. The very thought of revealing it
filled me with a nervous horror. But it is over
now, and by and by I want to impart to your tender
sympathies half of the burden I have so long
carried. You do not know how unendurable its
weight has become. O Grace, it is dreadful to
be obliged to endure for years the pains of a
wounded heart. To feel its throbbings day after
day without the power to claim a panacea from another's
love."</p>

<p>Grace started.</p>

<p>"It must be true," she thought, "and am I to
thus endure?"</p>

<p>Ah! little did she know how the first deep
wounds, that seemingly "will never heal," can be
soothed in some hearts, while in others no power
can assuage the pain. Grace Stanley could forget,
for the sunshine of her nature was salutary.</p>

<p>At this juncture Tezzie appeared in the doorway,
and announced that "Missus wanted do young
ladies to dress fine for dinner, for Massa Charles
was coming back wid a strange gemman."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, we will be ready in good time," replied
Lillian. "Now go and call Agnes to arrange
my hair."</p>

<p>The dark, dumpy figure disappeared from sight,
and Lillian, bowing her head, kissed again the
pure white forehead of her companion.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, dear, I want your little heart to
beat in sympathy with my own. Good by," and
Grace left the room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3><a name="THE_MOTHERS_CURSE" id="THE_MOTHERS_CURSE"></a>THE MOTHER'S CURSE.</h3>


<p>"There, Agnes, you may go now. How do you
like my looks? Will I do to appear before the
the strange gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Look, Miss Lily? Why you look like the
buful cloud I seed lyin' so soft and still in de sunshine,
honey. But I like the white dress more, for
den you look just like de angels, waiting for de
wings."</p>

<p>"That will do. You have imagination sufficient
for a poet, Agnes, but you may go now."</p>

<p>She smiled as she waved her hand towards the
door with a delicate movement, and she was alone.
Only a moment, however, for the faithful servant
had just disappeared when the door reopened and
Mrs. Belmont entered the apartment. She was still
graceful and queenly in her bearing, and her long
black dress swept the rich carpet with an imperious
air. Time had been very gentle with that
fair face, touching lightly her brow with his unwelcome
traces, neither quenching the fire in her
dark eyes nor dulling the lustre of her glossy hair.
Yet her regal head had a habit of drooping, as if
weary of its weight of thought, and her lips became
more and more compressed as their color
faded and lines of anxious care grew deeper as
the years rolled by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"I came to tell you that there was to be company
at dinner."</p>

<p>"Not before? I understood Tezzie to say there
would be a stranger here at lunch."</p>

<p>"It may be so; Charles is to bring home a college
friend, I believe."</p>

<p>This would have been very unsatisfactory under
some circumstances, but Lillian was not curious.
As her mother entered the room she discovered
that strange, wild light in her eyes which she had
seen there many times before, and well knew that
beneath it a hidden fire was raging. Mrs. Belmont
had not once looked into the face of her
daughter, but had seated herself by the open window,
her elbow on the heavy frame-work, while her
head rested wearily upon her hand. A soft, warm
breeze came softly and caressed her with its perfumed
wings, fanning her heated brow, and whispering
all the time the sweetest words of purity
and peace through the interwoven branches of the
luxurious vine outside. In her heart, however,
were discordant notes to which she was listening,
having no ear for other sounds, were they ever so
melodious.</p>

<p>"Lillian," she said, at last, "did you reject
George St. Clair this morning?"</p>

<p>"I did, Mother."</p>

<p>"You did?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>The daughter spoke quietly and calmly, but Mrs.
Belmont arose hurriedly from the chair and stood
before her.</p>

<p>Lillian did not quail before the burning look
which was fixed upon her, but returned it with
a determined gaze, out of which pity and filial
affection beamed their gentle rays.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Child! child! this must not&mdash;cannot be! I
command you to recall him. It is not too late. He
loves you, and would, without doubt, overlook this
unparalleled freak of foolishness in which you have
been so unaccountably indulging. Recall him,
Lillian; your whole future happiness depends
upon it."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Mother; I never could have
been happy had I accepted that true, noble heart,
and given in exchange my poor broken and divided
one, and certainly he never could have taken me
into his great love after knowing me as I am,
which he surely must have done, or I, at least,
would have been eternally wretched."</p>

<p>"You did not tell him?" was the quick inquiry.</p>

<p>"I told him that <i>I was a wife</i>. That my heart
was forever bound up in those matrimonial vows
still unsevered, and that I loved him as a brother,
and no more."</p>

<p>"You are mad! a fool! You know not what
you do," and trembling with excitement she sank
back on the chair from which she had risen.</p>

<p>Lillian did not speak or move, but tears came
welling up through the freshly opened wounds in
her poor heart, and filled her large pensive eyes
with their bitter moisture.</p>

<p>Again the mother spoke.</p>

<p>"I feel disposed, just now, to enlighten you a
little in regard to your future prospects if you persist
in this silly sentimental mood, which you seem
to think so becoming! I have striven hard to keep
it from you and your brother for many years, and
to surround you with every luxury your inherited
station really demanded. More than this, I have
planned, wrought, and guided with true maternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
skill and instinct the fortunes of you both in such
a manner that you might, if you would, ever retain
your enviable position in the social world, for which
I have exerted myself to fit you."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, Mother. Be merciful
and enlighten me, as you offered to do."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will; but you will not find much mercy
in it. Know, then, that we are not owners of this
beautiful estate. On the contrary, it was mortgaged
to the father of George St. Clair by your
own father some time before his death. Think, if
you can, of the long years of toil I have experienced
since that time, and ask if you are right in
pulling down about our heads the whole structure
of prosperity and affluence that I have been so long
in building."</p>

<p>"I discern your intricate plans, my Mother, and
pity you."</p>

<p>"Pity me? Do you then persist in your folly?
I have proven to you then that it is in your power
to avert this ruin! Mr. St. Clair told me not long
since that Rosedale would eventually belong to his
son, and he was happy to feel quite sure that my
daughter would share it with him. I cannot much
longer keep the Gorgon from devouring us! All
we can then call our own will be the negroes, and
these, without doubt, will depreciate much in value
if the anticipated war of the North really comes
upon us! Decide Lillian! Tell me that you will
accede to my wishes in recalling George St. Clair!
That northern mud-sill has, without doubt, long
before this returned to his native element. He is
dead to you&mdash;as wholly, truly so as though you
had never been guilty of so great an indiscretion!"
Lillian started to her feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother, one question! Did you not receive a
letter from my aunt in Philadelphia not many
months ago saying that my husband had risen
high in the estimation of the people and was true
to his early vows? Has that information ever
been contradicted? I read in the pallor of your
face that it has not! His heart beats as truly for
me to-day as it did sixteen years ago&mdash;and I am
<i>his wife</i>! He is the father of my sweet Lily-bud,
and this bond can never be severed! No, no! I
cannot, I <i>will not</i>, wed another!"</p>

<p>"<i>The curse of the heart-broken then rest upon
you!</i>" She had moved away with rapid steps
while speaking, and although Lillian reached out
her hand imploringly the stately figure disappeared
through the open door. O the speechless agony
of the next hour! O the suffering in that lonely,
sad, luxurious chamber! All the misery of her
eventful life came rushing over her! Spectral
thoughts, that she had supposed were long since
banished forever, haunted her brain! How vivid
and real they now appeared in this new darkness.
Then the future! Where was the black hand of
destiny to lead her? Even now she could see it
reaching out its bony fingers from among the
mysteries that enveloped her hidden path! The
thick folds of an interminable gloom seemed to
have fallen about her, and everywhere she beheld
that "mother's curse" written in letters of fire!
A rap was heard on the door and she arose
mechanically and turned the key. Soon the sound
of a heavy tread was heard along the hall&mdash;then
down the winding staircase and lost in the distance.
It was Tezzie, and she was alone again!
By and by the echoes of music and laughter came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
floating up through the open window and mingled
harshly with the dreariness which pervaded that
silent chamber! There was a merry group in the
spacious drawing-room before the dinner hour arrived.
Where was the wretched mother? Could
it be that those rigid features which disappointment,
consternation and rage had blanched with
their inhuman concoctions was covered with a
mask of conviviality and pleasure? Lillian wept!
It was well that tears came at last or the poor
brain would have become parched with the fever of
its wild despair! The sunshine at last departed
from the window and night let down its black,
silken curtains around a weary tumultuous world.
O, how many hearts sink helplessly beneath their
weight of woe, crushing under it the joy from the
outside world with its wealth of pomp and gaiety!
Yet there are those who, when the day departs, throw
aside the sackcloth with which they hide their
misery and come with all their sorrows to the feet
of Him whose smiles alone have the power to dispel
their gloom. Lillian did not know how to
pray! In all her years of perplexity and doubt
she had not reached out her hand to the only one
who could have led her safely out of it all. Now
her heart called for something it had not yet
divined, but the perplexed soul was wistfully gazing
upward through the thick clouds that drooped
so closely about her, and a feeble wail issued from
beneath the sombre darkness. Another low tap
was heard on the door which again aroused her.
There had been many during the hours of her
self-imprisonment, but she had not heeded them.
However, a low, sweet voice penetrated her solitude
and fell with soothing cadence upon her ear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's Auntie, honey&mdash;open the door, poor lamb;"
and Lillian's quick step revealed the willingness
with which she complied. The faithful old slave
came in and the door was relocked.</p>

<p>"What fo' you killin' yo'self here all alone,
honey? I know'd dar was trouble all day and I
just been askin' de good Lord to take care of you;
but I did want to come and see if he'd done it&mdash;poo'
lamb!" Aunt Vina had drawn her chair
close to the side of Lillian, and the weary head
with its heavy weight of sorrow had fallen upon
the shoulder of her faithful friend. "Dar&mdash;bress
you honey&mdash;cry all yo' trouble out. Dat's de way
de bressed Lord helps us to get rid on 'em. By
an' by sweet lamb He'll wipe 'em all away; den
ye'll hab no mo' sorrow, honey, bress de Lord!"</p>

<p>"But I have now more than I can bear! You
don't know what a terrible load I am being crushed
beneath!"</p>

<p>"I know a good deal, chile. Missus told me to-day
dat you wouldn't marry Massa St. Clair, and
she 'spects you was pinin' at somethin' she said!
I axed her if I might come and see you and she
didn't care, but wanted I should make you ''bey
yo' mudder'; now de Lord knows better dan she
do."</p>

<p>"Did she tell you that she cursed me? O&mdash;Auntie!
I could bear all the rest, even the miserable
future she has pictured to me; but it is dreadful
to carry through life the terrible burden of a
mother's curse."</p>

<p>"Neber you min', honey; de Lord'll pay no
'tention to such cussin', an' it won't hurt ye a bit,
if ye don't keep thinkin' on it. Why can't ye tell
Him all about it, poor chile, den t'row it all away?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
He'll take good care ob it, sure, and it won't hurt
you."</p>

<p>"Do you believe, Aunt Vina, that God cares
anything about me? Would He listen if I should
ask Him to take my cause into His hands?"</p>

<p>"Sartin He would, honey. He lubs you ten times
mo' dan old auntie, and wouldn't she take ebery
bit ob it if she could?"</p>

<p>The rough hand of the slave woman touched
with soft caress the tear-stained cheek that was
resting so near her own, and the cheering words
fell into her aching heart with a soothing influence.</p>

<p>"Pray for me, Auntie, and I will try to do as you
have bidden. The road is very dark and gloomy
where my faltering feet are standing, but it may
be as you say, that God will drive it all away."</p>

<p>"O bress de Lord, bress de Lord! Auntie knows
ye'll fin' it. Never mind nothin', go tell Him
eberythin', and see how de dark will all go 'way.
Dar, honey; old Vina'll go and get ye a good cup
o' tea, and bring in de lamp and make it more
cheery like. De good Lord'll take care ob de
lamb!"</p>

<p>"Where is Grace?" was the plaintive query.</p>

<p>"O Miss Grace, she's 'most crazy 'bout you. I
seed her alone in de little arbor cryin' dreadful
awhile ago; but den she puts 'em 'way quick, and
her pretty face looks all happy agin. She was
singin' at de pianner when I come up."</p>

<p>"Tell her, Auntie, not to come to me until to-morrow.
I wish to be left alone to-night. You may
bring me a cup of tea, then tell Agnes that I shall
not want her," was the pleading wail of the sorrowing
heart as the slave woman disappeared on
her errand of love and tenderness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Fold thy wings lovingly over the bowed form of
the humble suppliant, O angel of pity, for the
Father hears the cry of his suffering children; not
one ever pleaded in vain, and Lillian prayed!</p>

<h3><a name="THE_MYSTERIOUS_LETTER" id="THE_MYSTERIOUS_LETTER"></a>THE MYSTERIOUS LETTER.</h3>


<p>It was not until late the next day that Lillian
granted the oft repeated request of her cousin to
be allowed to come to her, and not a moment was
lost ere the two friends were together.</p>

<p>"It was cruel in you, my sweet Lillian, to banish
me so long, but how ill you look," and Grace Stanley
clasped her arms about the dear form and
kissed the pale cheek tenderly.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, pretty cousin, in my general
appearance, for I have not been so well in a long
time. In fact, your 'poor despondent cousin' is
almost happy to-day."</p>

<p>Lillian was looking into the face of her companion
while her pure liquid eyes were overflowing
with the new-found joy that was filling her heart.</p>

<p>"I have been troubled, Grace. Yesterday a
heavy wave rolled over me, that came near burying
your 'Lily Bell' beneath it. But it has passed
on, and I was left out of the tempest, and a hand
reached out to hold me as I was going down beneath
the roaring billows. At any rate I am standing
firm to-day, and have no fears of winds or
storms. Somehow I feel secure in the belief that
I shall be shielded and brought through it all,"
and the fair head drooped for awhile on her hand,
and the joyful tears came and baptised afresh her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
trembling new-born hope. Grace had no word of
trust to lay on the altar of consecration, and could
only sit at the feet of her who was casting her all
upon it, and be silent.</p>

<p>"Forgive me cousin, my heart and thoughts
have been straying. I wanted to talk with you
that I might, if possible, break the last cord that
binds me so tenaciously to the dark scenes of the
past that I would bury forever."</p>

<p>"Are you able, Lillian, to bear the agitation
such a conversation would subject you to?" interposed
Grace, with much feeling. "It would make
me very happy to know you had opened wide the
door of your poor heart and taken me into its
sacred places, yet I would not give you the slightest
needless pain."</p>

<p>"Thoughtful as ever, darling; but I feel quite
sufficient for the task. Yesterday you heard me
tell George St. Clair of my marriage, and how my
mother came to the city and influenced me to go
with her. No doubt you think it strange, as he
did, that no greater effort has been made by my
husband to reclaim his lost bride. I could not tell
him all, the old habitual fear made me silent. I
am free to-day, and my confidence is unfettered.
No power could have kept him but the one this
guilty hand set up between us."</p>

<p>"You, Lillian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Grace, I did it. Not willingly, not quite
consciously, yet I did it."</p>

<p>Grace looked puzzled, and her bright eyes were
fixed intently on the sweet face she so loved, then
she said, "Go on."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was the night before our departure from
Philadelphia when, seeing the postman coming
down the street, I ran out to meet him, for something
seemed to tell me he had a letter that would
gladden my poor heart. I was not mistaken. It
was from Pearl, and O what a wealth of love it contained.
He would be at home in a week. The business
that had called him away was almost finished.
'Then, dearest,' he added, 'no king was ever
more ecstatic over his crown than I shall be with
my own pure Lily.'"</p>

<p>"'Pure!' How that word thrust itself home to
my poor quivering heart. I had run with the precious
missive to my room, and there, as the evening
shades settled down about me, I raved in my agony
with the madness of delirium. <i>I would not leave
him!</i> Alone that night I would fly into the darkness
leaving behind me forever those who would
tear me from him. By and by my mother came in
with her soft, soothing tones, she pitied and
caressed me. It was not at all strange, she said,
that I, a child, should struggle in the arms of wisdom.
I was weak now, but by-and-by I could walk
alone, then would come her reward. She was laboring
for my good only, and when I could look at
it I calmly would bless her for it. We would go
to England, where my father's relatives were living,
and she would cause pleasure to fall around
me as bountiful as summer rain. After a few years
of travel and study, if I then should find my heart
still clinging to its 'imaginary' love, I should return
to the object of my tried devotion. O how
gradually but surely did my silly heart yield to
this sophistry! In a few hours I was her submissive
tool. The fascination of a European tour, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
pictures of Parisian frivolities, and the glitter of
pomp and fashion in the society into which I might
plunge and come forth sparkling with its polished
gems for all future adorning, captured my bewildered
senses and stilled my whirling brain. In the
morning we were to start on our journey, would I
like to leave a few words for him who would probably
for a while grieve at my absence and mourn
over his disappointment? It would not, however,
last long, such troubles never do with these of his
sex, she said, and I should not certainly make myself
uncomfortable about it. Nothing could be
more to my wishes, and then I was told that she
had written a short letter which I had better copy,
as my head was not clear enough to think intelligently.
It would help him to forget his disappointment
and make him happy, just as I wished
him to be. O <i>that letter!</i> I can only give you its
purport; that I can never forget. It told him that
terrible falsehood that I went from him willingly
believing it not only to be my duty, but better
for us both. Then it went on to say that I had
come to the conclusion since his absence, that my
affections were fleeting with my childhood; but if
in after years I found that I was mistaken I would
frankly write and tell him so; until then I wished
he would not try to see or hear from me. Georgia
would not be a pleasant place for a northern 'abolitionist'
like himself to visit, and should he presume
upon so rash an act, I had no doubt my
mother would not fail to incense the people against
him, and pleaded that for my sake he would not
attempt it. He might have suspected the origin
of that infamous epistle, had not a cunning brain
devised and executed it. O Grace, dear Grace!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
how can you hold that perjured hand so closely in
your own?"</p>

<p>"It is pure and white my Lily Bell; no sin-stain
mars its beauty. Heart and hand are free
from such implications. But you told him also
that you were going to Europe?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, and that it would be uncertain when
we should return. We went as anticipated the next
morning, taking with us one hired servant. This
seemed strange to me at that time, as I supposed
we were to return to our southern home immediately
and would need no one if this be so. I
soon found, however, our route lay in a different
direction. I cannot tell where we spent the summer
months, but it was in a small cottage in a
wild, dreary place not so far from human habitation
but that Margeret could go twice a week in a
few hours to procure the necessities on which we
subsisted. The first of October we left this retreat
where I had spent so many wretched hours under
the surveillance of my mother, and after two days
of tiresome travel by private carriage and cars we
arrived at the seashore. There we took possession
of a summer residence on a high cliff that overlooked
the water, which showed signs of not having
been long vacated. Here in less than three
weeks I became a mother! Can I tell you about
it? O the terrible suspicions that arise in my
poor brain as I remember that scene! Only once
did I look on my sweet lily bud! I cannot make
you understand the rapture of that moment! It
was <i>mine</i>&mdash;it was <i>his</i>! How I longed that he
should see our beautiful flower; and then I said
'her name shall be Lily-Pearl, and that shall be
the inseparable tie between us.' I was very ill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
for a long time they told me, and when my fluttering
life came back with its full powers I was
informed that my beautiful bud had withered and
died and lay sleeping in the elegant robe my
hands had taken such pleasure in forming.
Grace&mdash;God forgive me if I impute wrong to the
innocent; but here in the presence of Him into
whose hands I have committed my cause I assert
my belief that the terrible blow that came near
severing the brittle, trembling thread of life was a
base fabrication and that my child is not dead!"</p>

<p>"Lillian! Lillian! I know it is a dreadful accusation,
but listen! You know I was in London
five years and then my mother came for me. In
one year more we returned home. Not many
weeks after my arrival I was passing through the
east hall when little Tommy came running to me
with a folded paper in his hand. He said he had
picked it up from the floor and I took it. It
proved to be a letter written to my mother without
date or signature. It was hardly legible, for it
was evident that the hand by which it was written
was unused to the pen. The writer, however,
complained of neglect and said the bargain made
in regard to the child had not been complied with;
that she was worthless to them, and if the three
hundred dollars did not come soon my mother
must find another place for her. <i>What child can</i>
my mother possibly have any interest in? Something
further was said about her being six years
old which I could not make out. A terrible conviction
took possession of me! <i>This was my child!
My Lily!</i> And who knows but ere this she has
been sent out into the world in default of this paltry
three hundred! Goaded by my suspicions I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
rushed into the presence of my mother with that
mysterious paper burning in my hand! 'What
is this? <i>What</i> does it mean? <i>What</i> child is the
heartless wretch talking about?' I almost gasped
so ungovernably did my brain reel beneath the
weight of this fearful apprehension. Never shall
I forget the look that greeted me! She was standing
before the mirror in her dressing-room as I
entered, but turned quickly as my tremulous
voice fell upon her ear. Her face was as pale and
livid as the marble statuette near which she was
standing, while her eyes flashed with the inward
fire she vainly endeavored to conceal. '<i>Give me
that paper!</i>' she demanded with extended hand;
'how did you come by it?' 'Tell me first!' I exclaimed;
'<i>who is the child</i> spoken of in it? I
<i>must</i>&mdash;I <i>will</i> know!' She stared wildly at me,
while a ghastly smile spread itself over her pallid
features and suddenly her voice sank to a low
musical cadence peculiar to herself as you well
know, Grace, and somehow it has never failed to
bring my most stubborn will in meek subjection
to her feet. 'Lillian, my child,' she said; '<i>why</i>
are you so much agitated? Compose yourself;
such fits of anger is not at all becoming! The
story of the child in whom you seem so much interested
is a very short one. I should have confided
it to you long ago, if by so doing I would not
have been obliged to reveal a secret which I could
not have told with honor. I will now, however,
satisfy your curiosity in a measure. You know
that I have both relatives and friends in Savannah,
one of these had a daughter who a few years ago
became a mother of an illegitimate child; of course
the mortification must be hidden if possible from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the world, and much against my will I became an
accomplice in the affair. This is the one alluded
to in that document you hold so tenaciously in
your hand. Now give it to me and forget the subject
altogether.' She reached for it, and with her
eyes gazing steadily into mine took it from me
and walked with a firm tread through an opposite
door, leaving me standing alone conquered but not
convinced. Do not think harshly of me, dear
Grace, I know my mother is your beloved aunt,
and for this reason I confide in you. I would not
let my suspicions loose upon the world, but something
has whispered to me many times since that
day that Lily did not die in her infancy, and can
you imagine my agony when I realize that now
she may be homeless and friendless, or what is
equally dreadful to me surrounded perhaps with
evil associations growing up into womanhood unlovely
and unloved?" The head of the agitated
Lillian sank down on the shoulder of her companion,
and clasped in each other's arms the two
mingled their tears of sorrow and sympathy.
During all this time Lillian had spoken kindly of
the cause of all this treachery and guilt! She
was dealing with the great sad past&mdash;unclasping
it link by link from her present and future as one
throws off accumulated burdens when preparing
for laborious action. She had secretly before this
laid them all at the feet of Him who had said,
"cast thy burdens on the Lord and he will sustain
thee." His promises she felt were true and
she expected to be assisted over the road that
seemed stretching itself among the thick shadows
farther than her faith could penetrate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>A few hours before this conversation when alone
with her blessed Saviour she had said with quivering
lips and wildly throbbing heart: "Forgive
the poor wailing cry, for I cannot hush its sobbings!
Rachel wept for her children and would
not be comforted&mdash;my child is not&mdash;not dead, or
the mother love would cease its calling," and then
she prayed: "Thou who noticest the fall of a little
sparrow watch over and protect my Lily! Shield
her&mdash;lead her in a path where I may find her."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3><a name="SCENES_ON_THE_PLANTATION" id="SCENES_ON_THE_PLANTATION"></a>SCENES ON THE PLANTATION.</h3>


<p>Autumn came at last. The heart of the great
Republic throbbed with unsteady pulsation, and,
every nerve in the body politic thrilled with excitement
as the looked-for crisis drew near. There
were faint whisperings in each breeze, so low at
first that every ear was strained to the uttermost
tension to catch the vibrating strains, but soon
they became louder and louder until the foundations
of peace and prosperity were shaken to their
very center. "War, war!" It was talked of everywhere.
In the salon, in the dining hall, not even
were the parlor and boudoir exempt from the unwelcome
sounds. The politicians discussed it over
their wine, and unfledged aspirants for fame probed
the bare possibilities in secret conclaves. Ebony
forms crowded beneath windows and balconies with
eyes and lips protruded, eager to catch the mysterious
meaning of the universal subject, "war!"
Aristocracy in the brilliant halls of pleasure and
revelry saw the strange hand appear and the finger
writing upon the wall. How flushed cheeks
paled, and rosy lips changed to ashy hue, and how
knees smote together with fear. "War! war!" A
cloud, dark and murky, rolled up from the horizon
full of terrible mutterings, and loaded with death
and devastation, moving steadily onward, until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
broad clear sky was covered, and the rays that had
so long fallen upon a prosperous people were shut
out, and shadows deep and portentous drooped
their heavy folds about the agitated nation. Mothers
all over the land gazed through blinding tears
upon their noble sons, who stood with elevated
brows around the home fires. Wives thrust back
their true devotion into the secret chambers of agonized
hearts, and pressed more closely the pallid
lips, and remained silent.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was not another in the whole land
who was more bitter towards those who had caused
these preparations of calamity than was Mrs. Belmont.
True, she had her own ideas who these
were, as well as all others throughout both sections
of the Republic. Having been for so many years
upheld in her present position of luxury and ease
by sable hands, it was no very agreeable prospect,
surely, to discover a mere possibility that they
might at some future time be giving way beneath
her.</p>

<p>The lady of Rosedale with her son and daughter
had been in the habit of spending several weeks
during the winter in Savannah, but now her arrangements
for the season were materially changed,
Lillian having gone to New Orleans with her
cousin Grace for an unlimited time, the mother and
son would go immediately without her.</p>

<p>The cloud had never disappeared from the family
horizon since that eventful day when George
St. Clair left Rosedale a rejected lover. The
daughter would not recall him with a promise of
her love or her hand, and consequently the shadow
of her mother's anger hung over her, dark and
gloomy. There were no filial tears shed at parting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
nor were there words of regret, or even one
sweet, maternal kiss. How sad, how very sad,
that such things must be. Can human love die?
That healthful seed which God planted so tenderly
in every heart to make life endurable as well as
beautiful with its buds and blossoms&mdash;can all this
ever be rooted up? True, its flowers may wither,
its bright green leaves may fade and fall, its tender
stalks even be broken, but the roots, the deeply
imbedded roots&mdash;<i>they</i> can never, never die. Smother
them with cruelties and wrongs, if you will, bury
them beneath the accumulated rubbish of selfishness
and misconduct, there will come a time when
the warm sunshine of tender memories and the soft
dews of genial affections, which the hand of divinity
shall scatter over it, will bring forth fresh shoots
from the hidden life of the heart's immortal love.</p>

<p>No, it cannot die; or why did Mrs. Belmont
hurry into her private apartment, as soon as the
sound of the rolling wheels that were bearing her
daughter from her was lost in the distance, to give
vent there to pent up tears? It might have been
remorse, it is true, for the last look on that pale
face, as Lillian waved her adieus from the carriage
window, would not leave her. There were tears
also on Aunt Vina's cheeks, although she endeavored
to hide them, amid her merry laughter, as she
took off her well-worn shoe to throw after her departing
darling. But Lillian felt that there was
more good luck in her parting words and benediction
than in this. "De good Lord bress ye, honey,
and bring ye back to poo' old Vina!"</p>

<p>"Pray for me, Auntie, while I am gone," was the
feeble response from the sore and aching heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dat I will ebery day, sartin! And don't ye
mind nothin'! Just ye be happy; dat's all!"</p>

<p>But there came an hour when the warm sunshine
gathered up its little gems of joy from out
the poor twisted life of the humble slave, and left
the heart bleeding beneath the gloomy shadows
where it had been stricken. No one knew how it
came about&mdash;but one bright morning when the
orange groves were full of birds, who had arrived
from their northern homes before the wintry blasts
had reached them, little Shady was found in the
store-house lying beneath a huge bale of cotton
quite dead! The overseer "had seen him frolicking
like a kitten among them and told him not to
climb to the top one, as he seemed inclined to do;"
and that was all that could be revealed of the sad
story! It was night now to old Vina! Nowhere
in her desolate heart could she find the sweet balm
she had so often poured into the wounds of other's
griefs. Above her shone no star with silvery ray
to light up the dark despair! Grief has many
fangs, all sharp and poisonous and hard to be
borne as they pierce through the sensitive nerves
of the human heart; but some strike deeper than
others, letting out the very life of the soul and
flooding the secret chambers with the malaria of
woe! Aunt Vina felt all this when at last the little
form she had so loved and cherished was laid
away in its cheerless bed among the buttonwood
trees, where her hand could reach him no more
with its cheery good-night. What was there now
to keep her tired feet from faltering by the way,
or her heart from sinking under its weight of life's
sorrows? When the last sod was laid tenderly on
the little grave, and "Parson Tom" had said in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
his most solemn tones "de Lord gabe and de Lord
hab taken away; and bressed be de name ob de
Lord," she turned away from it all with no responsive
"bress de Lord" bubbling up through
the torn fissures of her bleeding heart, and sought
her accustomed place by the kitchen grate. Without
a tear or moan she sank down upon a chair,
her head drooping low upon her broad chest,
sitting there as motionless and still as though the
lamp of her existence had also been blown out. In
vain did dark forms gather about her with their
tears of sympathy and words of condolence and
love! She heeded them not! The soft, warm
beams of the noonday sun came in through the
door and gathered themselves about her bowed
form, but she moved not. When the shadows of
night crept in she arose and stole away into the
thick darkness of her chamber to pray alone! No
eye but His who wept tears of sympathy at the
tomb of Lazarus witnessed the agony that night of
the poor heart-broken slave. No ear but His who
will wipe away all tears listened to the moans and
prayers that were borne upward on the wings of
departing night from that humble chamber! God
heard them, however, and a register was made in
that book which is to be opened on that great day
of accounts when one more spotless robe of white
was ready for her who had "come up through
much tribulation!"</p>

<p>The next morning, earlier than usual, Aunt
Vina appeared in her accustomed place. Her
cheeks were hollow and her eyes sunken, yet she
moved about with steady step gathering up every
trace of her lost darling, burning the few scattered
blocks he had brought in that sad day he went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to come in no more, throwing far back into the
dark closet the tattered hat and much-used whip,
as if by so doing she could hide the sorrow that
was eating away her life. And thus she labored
on.</p>

<p>The house was indeed empty now! "Pete"
had gone with his young master, and Emily, the
particular favorite of her mistress, was with her in
Savannah, and poor Aunt Vina turned her heart's
longings towards the absent Lillian. "If she was
only here," she would say over and over again;
"de wee lamb! De Lord knows how to pity dem
dat lub Him!"</p>

<p>"And don't you lub Him, Vina?" asked the
kind old preacher, who strove in his feeble way to
comfort the bereaved one.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;brudder Tom; but somehow dese
old eyes can't see out straight. He was all that
was left; it seems as how I might hab dat one little
head to lie on dis lone bosom! It won't be long
'fore I shall be 'tro wid it all&mdash;and it wouldn't 'a'
hurt nothin' if he been lef till I went home!"
Tears mingled with her sobs as she bewailed her
loneliness.</p>

<p>"De Lord say 'come unto me when tired and
can't find nowhere for de sole ob de foot, and He
will gib you rest;" and the good man laid his
ebony hand on the bowed head as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Don't I know it, brudder Tom? He's all right;
but it's hard to bress de Lord when He makes it
so dark; maybe by and by old Vina can look up!
If Miss Lillian was here <i>she</i> would tell me how."</p>

<p>How many have thus bent beneath the rod as
they hid the light of faith from them, "refusing
to be comforted" when the pitying Father was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
ready to bind up the heart His careful love had
wounded? "Before I was stricken I went astray"
is the testimony of many a happy soul. The
clouds are about us but the sun shines above them
all.</p>

<p>Lillian was gone and Rosedale somehow seemed
deserted and dreary. Perhaps it was because the
flowers were all withered and nature seemed going
to sleep; at any rate Mrs. Belmont and her son
concluded to go to the city immediately, even
should one or both of them be obliged to return to
the plantation during Christmas week.</p>

<p>"The servants always expect their holiday gifts,
and it would be too bad to disappoint them," so the
mistress said, "but it is insufferable here!" Besides,
Ellen St. Clair was to give a birthday entertainment
in two or three weeks, and as everybody
hinted the betrothal of the fair heiress with
Charles Belmont it really did seem a necessity
that he at least should be there. The mother of
the young gentleman also was exceedingly desirous
of satisfying herself upon this one point,
not feeling quite as sure as the veracious "Mrs.
Grundy." The reason being, no doubt, that the
said son, who had inherited from the maternal
side an abundance of the very commendable element
of secretiveness, did not seem at all disposed
to satisfy any one in regard to the matter as <i>he</i>
understood it. Neither was the mother quite sure
that he would from any cause be persuaded to
sacrifice any of his self-will for her accommodation,
for he was fully aware that her heart was
unswervingly set on this union. Thus she was
kept in ignorance which she was determined
should, if possible, be dispelled. All these things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
were taken into consideration by the intriguing
mother&mdash;and the son, not at all averse to the arrangements,
the next week found Aunt Vina sole
mistress of the great house at Rosedale.</p>

<p>Little Shady was in high spirits. Every day
the hall door was thrown wide open for the free
circulation of fresh air, then such a scrambling up
the broad stairs on all fours and such rapid rides
down the heavy balustrades! "Bress de chile!
Can't see no hurt no how! Missus say she lick
him, but she don't see him!" and the good old
grandmother turned her own head that her eyes
might not be at fault in the matter. The love for
this child was all the earth-spot the withered old
heart contained. All of her children, not excepting
her last, the mother of little Shady, had been
taken from her, some by death, others by the
greedy hands that snapped the tenderest cords of
the human hearts that its own mercenary ends
might be reached. "But it's a mercy dat I'se got
dis one," she would often repeat to herself as if
not quite sure of her resignation in the matter.
Certain it was that the merry gambols of the
frolicsome boy as her loving eyes followed him
through the day, and the joy of feeling his plump
arms around her neck at night, shut out in a great
measure the dark agonizing past from her view.</p>

<p>Outside of the elegant appointments of the
home and its surroundings all was left as usual in
the hands of the overseer, who was expected to
administer kindness and justice with wisdom, if
not with discretion; but as Pete had often said in
the quiet of Aunt Vina's kitchen fire, "Massa
Firey and old Tige look jist like 's do' day was
brudders," and as to disposition and characters it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
could not be disputed that they were similar.
Still, at the "quarters" he was not only feared but
regarded with a kind of respect and awe. Three
weeks passed away and little had been thought of
the dark cloud spreading itself over the nation, for
"Massa Firey" said nothing to those under his
care, if indeed he knew what was really going on in
the outside world.</p>

<p>There was plenty of work in the cotton-fields,
for Mrs. Belmont had said before her departure
that Charles would want some money and the
product of the plantation must be put into the
market as soon as it was open. Shady was in high
glee, snapping his whip at some imaginary intruder
about the extensive grounds or rolling his
hoop, when the sweet voice of the child would
steal in through the open windows and doors into
Aunt Vina's kitchen, awaking the worn-out melodies
of her own heart which would come forth in
answering chorus. A little curly head was often
thrust in through some aperture near, when the
song would suddenly change as the dark eyes
sparkled with mock terror at the words caught
from the sabbath services,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Git away you Satan, fo' de Lo'd is on the way,"</p></div>

<p>and the rotund figure of the old grandmother would
shake with suppressed merriment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3><a name="THE_BIRTHDAY_ENTERTAINMENT" id="THE_BIRTHDAY_ENTERTAINMENT"></a>THE BIRTHDAY ENTERTAINMENT.</h3>


<p>During the night, when poor Aunt Vina was bemoaning
her loss, very different scenes were being
enacted at the residence of the St. Clair's, in which
Mrs. Belmont was happily participating. It was
the birthday of Ellen St. Clair, the youngest and
pet of the family, who had but a few weeks previously
returned from New York, where she had
been for three years at school; and this, her twentieth
birthday, was to be the occasion of unlimited
enjoyment. The grounds as well as the mansion
were brilliantly illuminated, and the spacious apartments
crowded with wealth and beauty. Nothing
was left undone that could add grandeur to the
fete or pleasure to the loved one for whom all this
magnificence and display were brought out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmont was a very particular friend and
distant relative of the family, and therefore had
gone over at an early hour that her suggestions and
experiences might not be wanting. She was immediately
shown to the private dressing-room of Mrs.
St. Clair, who was patiently suffering under the
skillful hands of her French dressing-maid.</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly glad that you came so early.
Pauline, ring the bell for a servant. You see the
house is to be crowded before dinner with friends
and relatives from New Orleans and Atlanta, and
it is as much as I can endure to be dressed three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
times in one day. O you need not laugh at my
indolence, as you usually do."</p>

<p>No one laughed, however, but the lady herself.</p>

<p>"Why, Pauline, you make me look like a fright,"
she exclaimed, catching a glimpse of herself in the
mirror before which she was sitting. "Can you
not bring those puffs back a little?"</p>

<p>"<i>C'est a la mode, chere Madame</i>," replied the
maid, smiling.</p>

<p>"You mean to say by that, I suppose, that it is
the latest style, and I must submit."</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, madame</i>."</p>

<p>"Very well, proceed then with the inevitable,"
and settling herself down quietly she went on chatting
with her visitor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason, a widowed daughter, who had returned
the year before to her childhood's home with
her three little children, came in for a moment,
then retreated as silently as she entered.</p>

<p>"Poor Bertha," exclaimed Mrs. Belmont, with
much feeling, "what a look of suffering she wears
upon her face. She seems to bemoan her loss now
as deeply as when first bereaved. How I pity
her!"</p>

<p>"Yes, the dear child, she misses her husband
much; but I tell her it is far better to rejoice over
the living than to mourn over the dead. Every
widowed mother has not three such beautiful and
interesting children as she. This, in time will, I
have no doubt, take away the acuteness of her sorrow,
but we must wait for the work to be accomplished."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Was Mrs. Belmont thinking of the time when,
years ago, beautiful children nestled into the inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
chamber of <i>her</i> soul, which had been desolated by
the hand of death? Or did her memory go no
farther back than the last parting scene with her
only daughter? There were many dark pictures
that might have been brought up, but the volubility
of Mrs. St. Clair drove them from her sight.
She continued:</p>

<p>"I dare say I shall shock your sensibilities very
much, but Ellen has declared her intention of bringing
the governess out to-night as one of her honored
guests." And the lady laughed heartily as she
looked into the face of her visitor.</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> are not going to permit it, certainly.
The affair would be decidedly absurd. You ought
most positively to interfere."</p>

<p>"But you know, my dear, that I was never emphatic
about anything. I have not the needed
strength for a battle. And then, on this occasion,
I am left perfectly powerless, as her father declares
that for this once she shall have her own way in
everything, just as if she did not always have it;"
added Mrs. St. Clair with much merriment.</p>

<p>"But does she not know that she may offend
many of her dear friends by such folly?" interposed
the lady of Rosedale.</p>

<p>"I imagine she cares but little as to that; she is
so much like her father&mdash;and mother, too, it may
be;" and the thick folds of her rich brocade rustled
with the contagion of her mirth. "The fact
is, cousin, she is such a fine musician that I have no
doubt you will be charmed with her yourself. To
be sure she holds a menial position in our home,
but I cannot help admiring and loving her too.
There is something so mild and unassuming about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
her. I often tell Ellen that I wish she would imitate
her manners."</p>

<p>"No doubt she is well enough in her place; but
the drawing-room, which is to be filled with the
elegant and affluent who are to come from aristocratic
homes, bringing with them refinement and
culture, must overshadow her. She ought certainly
to have sufficient sense to understand this, and refuse
such publicity. Why not as hostess appeal
to her yourself? If she is as amiable as you have
represented, she would not act in a way contrary
to your wishes."</p>

<p>All this was spoken hurriedly and with much
feeling.</p>

<p>"I presume she would; but the trouble is that
I <i>have</i> no objections. Under these circumstances
you will discover that I would make a poor deputy
to do the business;" and the merry peals startled
the demure maid who was putting the finishing
touches to her lady's toilet. Then turning to the
mirror she continued, without giving her visitor
time to reply:</p>

<p>"There&mdash;how do I look? Not much like Venus,
as I can readily perceive. Is not that trail too
long? and these hoops too large? But it will have
to do, I suppose. Now I will go and see what the
girls are doing, while Pauline's skillful fingers put
you in order. I had your dressing case brought
here so as to be ready;" and the good lady bustled
out of the room, leaving her cousin in no very amiable
mood.</p>

<p>At an early hour the sound of mirth and gayety
was heard everywhere in the elegant home
of the St. Clair's. The drawing-rooms were filled
with gay, flitting forms which kept humming and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
buzzing like a swarm of busy bees, mingling and
changing their bright colors until with kaleidoscopic
distinctness the last brooch was fastened
and each delicate toilet had received its finishing
touch from skillful hands, and on the broad stairway
the tripping of feet and the rustling of silks
mingled with joyous laughter as the chorus of
many voices were heard coming up from the hall
below. It was a brilliant sight! So many happy
faces gleaming with the excitement of the hour as
they gathered together in little circling eddies in
the drawing-rooms, radiant with gems which
flashed and sparkled in the full glare of the overhanging
gas-lights that glowed in subdued brilliancy
upon them.</p>

<p>"How very strange!" was heard from many a
rosy lip that night as familiar friends met in sly
nooks where confidential words could be interchanged.
It was true that Ellen St. Clair had
never appeared at such an entertainment so plainly
dressed; what could it mean? A rumor had been
floating about purporting to have originated with
her sister Bertha "that it was to please some one,"
but who was the honored one? Then there came
the response. "A governess who had declared
her dislike to appear in so large a company because
of her unfitting toilet!" But why this should
so strangely influence the "pretty heiress" was
still a mystery. "And where was the governess?"
No one was more eager to be satisfied on this point
than was Mrs. Belmont; and no one was more
anxious to hide that desire which so fretted her.</p>

<p>"I never saw Miss Ellen look prettier or fresher
than she does to-night," remarked a gentleman to
the captivating young Mrs. Mason. "That spotless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
dress of white becomes her airy figure and combines
with her purity of look and manner. Her
appearance is truly ethereal&mdash;and that one diamond
star at the throat reminds me of something in the
good book my mother used to read! In fact I like
it." A toss of the regal head beside him was the
only answer. "I am sorry, however, that her motive
for throwing aside her little feminine adornings
is so much beneath her," continued the young man
with some volubility. "But where is the governess?
I beg pardon!" and the head of the speaker
bowed low with mock seriousness.</p>

<p>"I do not know, sir; I have not troubled myself
about her!" was the haughty reply. "Exquisite!
Pray tell me who is that at the piano? A wonderful
voice! So sweet and flexible!" exclaimed
a lady near where the two were standing. "Listen!
I wish I could get a peep at her!"</p>

<p>"I do not know," interrupted Mrs. Belmont
who had been addressed. "I will inquire," and
she pressed her way through the crowd and was
lost from sight by the enraptured listeners. The
melodious voice soared aloft in little rippling
eddies to die away in the distance, then fell like
liquid drops of silvery cadence upon the ear, while
it hushed into silence the sound of mingling voices
until the spacious apartments were filled with
naught but the wonderful music of the unknown
singer. Mrs. Belmont had made her way to a
group of grave gentlemen and ladies in the parlor
opposite, where they had been discussing the great
topic of the day.</p>

<p>"I cannot see well," replied Mrs. St. Clair with
a merry twinkle in her gray eyes as she returned
to the sofa she had just left to look about her for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
a moment. "But it is some one Professor Edwards
seems to honor, for he is beside her turning the
music. Ah, there is 'Cathesdra'&mdash;listen," and the
same voice came floating and circling about their
heads in the very ecstacy of delight.</p>

<p>"You never heard that <i>sung</i> before;" interposed
Mr. St. Clair laughingly. "I mean as now!"</p>

<p>"You know who it is, cousin; tell us, will
you?" But Mr. St. Clair was wholly intent upon
the music and only shook his finger menacingly
at Mrs. Belmont for interrupting it.</p>

<p>"There! That is over! Now who says he
<i>ever</i> heard anything better than that?" and the
kind-hearted old gentleman gazed appealingly
about him.</p>

<p>"Let me see, cousin. What was it you were saying
about the 'uncultured females' of the north?
Well, I remember but will not repeat, so you
may save your blushes," and his plump hand
came down with emphasis upon his well-developed
knee. "Yes&mdash;they do soil their fingers with toil
it is a fact. Ellen has often spoken of her visit to
the home of a schoolmate who lives on the banks
of the old historic Hudson, and she declares that
the home into which she was ushered on her arrival
was superior to almost anything she had
seen in our sunny clime; but the mistress many
times during her stay of two weeks actually made
tea with her own hands and served it at her own
table! And what was even worse, there was not
a day that she did not visit her kitchen&mdash;order
her own dinner&mdash;and, it may be, stuffed her own
turkeys&mdash;made her own jellies, puddings, etc.! I
should not be at all surprised!" Here the speaker
burst forth into a merry peal of laughter, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
did not seem at all contagious as no one but the
wife joined in his glee. "Ah, there is the singer.
I know her by the blue silk," interposed one of
the ladies who had striven to get a look at her
while she was at the piano. "Prof. Edwards
seems to monopolize her entirely." "She is <i>very</i>
pretty," remarked another. "All but those blue
eyes," chimed in Mr. St. Clair; "those tell the
tale of frosts and snows&mdash;do you not think so,
cousin?"</p>

<p>"You annoy me, somehow," said Mrs. Belmont
with much feeling; "perhaps it is because I do
not understand you. I would like to cover your
lack of gallantry with a soft cloak of charity you
see."</p>

<p>"It is the war, madam, that had fired his bitter
animosities," suggested a gallant knight near by.</p>

<p>"Have I indeed then been so boorish? I beg
your pardon," and he bowed obsequiously. "Now
for plain dealing, as I feel you will like that better!
The young lady to whom we have been so
rapturously listening, and who has drawn such a
large circle about her yonder," pointing with his
finger towards where she was sitting, "including
your honored son, I perceive, is Miss Anna Pierson&mdash;our
governess. Look at her now! Her face
is like her music, all soul, all feeling. Now clear
and smooth with the most exquisite pathos, yet
never blank or uninteresting; now brilliant and
sparkling, rippling all over with enthusiasm; a
face one never tires of watching through all its
changes; never growing weary no matter how often
the repetition comes."</p>

<p>Immediately after supper Mrs. Belmont ordered
her carriage. She was anxious to return and bury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
her chagrin in the privacy of her own chamber.
Why was she so wretched? She asked herself
over and over again, yet received no definite answer.
It might be that a gentleman with whom
she had been talking assured her that the war so
much commented upon could not, or would not be
averted. "Even now," he added, "extensive preparations
are going on in Charleston for its early
commencement." But certainly this could not be
the cause of her disquietude, as she scanned over
the immensity of southern political power. After
all that has been done the fight must be short and
the victory speedy and glorious. The pall lifted
slowly from about her heart, and before she reached
her own door she stigmatized herself as a coward
for retiring so soon from the gay scene, appearing,
as she imagined, like retreating before a phantom
foe. In her own room, however, the fire broke out
anew. There was something in the tones of her
cousin's voice that angered her. "What right
had he to allude to my words, spoken in private,
and display my peculiar views, as he called them,
before such a company? But above all, what
could have induced Charles to hand that detestable
governess to the table and leave Ellen St. Clair
to another?" Nothing had gone right, and the
indignant woman paced the floor goaded by her agitating
thoughts until the footsteps of her offending
son were heard entering his room. How true
it is that when the heart opens its "guest chamber"
to evil spirits and gives them welcome, it will wake
ere long to find its most sacred place invaded, and
its halls of innocence desecrated by the madness of
associated passions that come to take up their abode
in it! Poor heart! What a struggle for purity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
must follow with opposing foes before it ever again
becomes a fit temple for the high dignitaries of a
God-like nature to enter and dwell in! Better far
to bar the door at their first approach and set its
seal of truth and nobleness upon it which, like the
"blood of sprinkling," turns away the footsteps of
Death with his destructive power. Alas, with Mrs.
Belmont it was too late. She had not counted the
cost of her misdeeds from the beginning, and now
found herself in a labyrinth of difficulties that were
thickening about her, and out of which she could
see no way of escape.</p>

<p>She was angry, too, for Bertha had said that
Ellen was indignant that her name should have
been coupled in an outside gossip with that of her
son, and had improved every opportunity to contradict
the rumor. Here was another disappointment
to be thrown into her cherished plans; and
the very depths of her soul seemed embittered.</p>

<p>Chafing under the accumulating power of her
goading thoughts, she walked her room with rapid
steps, while her angry soul went down among the
roaring billows.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3><a name="A_THRILLING_REVELATION" id="A_THRILLING_REVELATION"></a>A THRILLING REVELATION.</h3>


<p>Charles Belmont was twenty-six years of age
at the time of our writing, but owing to the indolence
of his disposition and the selfishness which
had always governed him, he had not as yet stepped
into the position as "master" of the plantation to
which he supposed himself heir; nor had he troubled
himself regarding his prosperity. It was
enough for him to know that a hundred pairs of
hands were laboring for his comfort and fully capable
of supplying every desired luxury. "Mother
has never failed me yet," he would say, "and when
she does it will be time enough for me to dabble in
business."</p>

<p>Thus did the years roll by while his manliness
became more and more engulfed in the lethargy
of indolence until his whole being was enervated
and possessed not the power to sever the
manacles that were destroying the pure and noble
within, even had he the disposition to do so. How
many efficient natures have thus been destroyed!
The soul of man is progressive; it is ambitious to
go onward and upward; fetter these propensities,
press them down, and the whole being becomes
groveling, its aspirations dwarfed or twisted in the
process. The mind is conscious of an unrest, and
with its unsatisfied longings, turns away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
ennobling and fills itself with debasing habits that
will certainly prostitute all loftier aspirations.
Charles Belmont had not, however, sunk so low as
all this. But with his most frivolous wants supplied,
and the prospect of a large estate before him,
why should he be perplexed about anything? He
had gone through college, as thousands of others
had done before him, had spent two years in Europe
seeing what in his opinion was worth looking
at, and now what was left for him to do but to look
out for an heiress or some one worthy to share his
honors, or wait while he smoked his meerschaum
or sipped his wine after the physical part of his
nature had been satisfied by the bounties which
menial hands had provided?</p>

<p>The next day after the events of our last chapter,
the young master of Rosedale learned from his
mother that for the first time since his remembrance
the slaves were to be disappointed in their
Christmas gifts, as the lady declared she "would
not trouble herself about them."</p>

<p>This piece of information aroused the better feelings
of the son, who immediately set about providing
himself with the means to carry out in its
fullness the long established custom that would
make more than three score hearts happy. It was
a frail spirit, however, that aroused for the first
time the slumbering attributes of his better nature.</p>

<p>"If such is your determination, Mother," was
the quick reply, "then I shall for once perform
your duties for you." And, true to his resolve,
Christmas morning found him standing amid well
filled baskets at the end of the long corridor leading
to the kitchen, looking upon the happy faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of the merry group as he called their names, and
with a cheery word or jest presented their gifts.</p>

<p>"Where is Old Auntie?" he inquired at last, as
the sable faces one by one turned away, and he was
being left alone. "And here is a drum for Shady,
but he must promise not to make too much noise
with it before I shall hand it over to him. Here,
Shady, you rascal, where are you?" he continued,
holding up the exhilarating toy. Poor Old Auntie
came out from the kitchen and walked slowly towards
him.</p>

<p>"O Massa, Shady am dead&mdash;gone&mdash;and poor old
Vina's heart is done broke. I don' want nothin',
massa, on'y dat what ye got fer him. Let auntie
have it&mdash;'twon't make no noise." She reached out
her hand for the coveted prize, and again Charles
Belmont felt the promptings of the inward nobility
that makes the man. Those plaintive words
that came sobbing up from the wounded, bleeding
heart, all dripping with tears, touched a chord of
sympathy in his own, hitherto unknown to its
possessor.</p>

<p>"How did this happen?" he asked quickly, "and
why was not my mother informed of an event so
important? Something is wrong. How did little
Shady die?"</p>

<p>"Don' know, massa. He's done dead. It's
night all de time now; dere ain't no more sunshine
for poor old auntie. Will ye gib me dat, massa?
I <i>couldn't</i> hear de chil'ens makin' a noise on it&mdash;'twould
be like dey was poundin' dis heart, all
broke, Massa Charles. Couldn't bear it&mdash;no how."</p>

<p>"You shall have it, Auntie," he said, with much
feeling, as he placed the toy drum in the outstretched
hands. "I do not wonder it is dark, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
if Massa Charles can scatter a few rays of light
across your sorrow, be sure he will do it."</p>

<p>"O thank ye; thank ye, Massa Charles. The
Lord will bless ye, Vina knows he will," and the
poor old slave returned again to her night of dreary
loneliness.</p>

<p>It was a little transient ray that had been sent
athwart her darkness, and no one understood its
fleetingness better than did she.</p>

<p>The next day Charles Belmont went again to the
scenes of pleasure he had so unceremoniously left,
but he could not forget the bitter potion the cup of
others contained. For a long time "Poor Old
Auntie's" wail of bereavement would dart into his
pleasures and leave a touch of sadness upon their
brightness.</p>

<p>On reaching Savannah he found that his mother
had gone with the St. Clair's to spend a week on a
plantation about thirty miles distant, and accepting
the invitation left for him, he prepared to follow.
It was a lovely morning when the party set
out on their short journey. They had determined
upon a carriage-ride for the whole distance, while
the others went by rail as far as they could, and
were waiting for the carriage to overtake them.
George St. Clair, his sister Ellen and Miss Pierson
composed the little party, as they wheeled over the
hard road as fast as the spirited horses could take
them, while the cool, fresh breeze invigorated their
young spirits.</p>

<p>"This air may be a little too bracing; shall I
not have the curtains unrolled?" asked George St.
Clair.</p>

<p>"O no, indeed!" replied Miss Pierson who was
addressed; "this reminds me of a spring day in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the north when there is snow yet upon the mountains
while the valleys are green."</p>

<p>"Perfectly natural that it should, for this wind
comes directly from your snow-capped hills;" was
the answer, while the young man experienced a
very perceptible shiver. "I wish it were not quite
so cold!"</p>

<p>"You would soon learn to like it as I do! Do
you perceive it has given me new life already?
But I have discovered my selfishness! Please put
down the curtains for you are looking quite miserable,"
she concluded, as she noticed on the face
opposite an expression not usual to it. It was his
thoughts, not the cool breeze however that had
chilled him. The raillery of his sister recalled him,
and he for a time put away the absorbing subject.
"Look Ellen! Really that pile of brush and mud
yonder is inhabited! Just see what miserable
creatures are coming out of it. One&mdash;two&mdash;three!
I wonder if that can be the mother now following.
She looks half-starved and utterly dejected! Do
look at them, Ellen!"</p>

<p>"You must not expend all your sympathy on
that one family," remarked Ellen carelessly; "for
you will see them all along the road. These belong
to the 'poor white trash,' as the coachman
would tell you with a curl of his ebony lip. They
are a small portion of that miserable class who
are so thoroughly steeped in degradation that
there is no hope of improving them."</p>

<p>Anna made no reply, but sat a long time
silently gazing out of the carriage window. Ellen
too was silent, while their companion watched the
speaking face of the humble governess as its color
came and went like the sunshine and shadows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
through which they were passing. At last she
awoke as from a dream, and laying her gloved
hand upon that of George St. Clair exclaimed:
"You are good and noble! Tell me, is there no
remedy for all this? I have heard so much of
these while in my northern home that my heart
truly aches for them! To be so utterly outcast as
the family appears to be that we have just passed,
and without the ambition or power to rise out of
it, is truly pitiful! What sad blots on the grand
picture of American civilization! Is there <i>no</i>
remedy?"</p>

<p>"No remedy!" was the low reply. They seemed
to be the echo only of her own words and brought
with them no consolation. "Pardon me," he said
a moment after; "we shall get dreadfully entangled
in a web of our own weaving if we continue on
this train of thought. Let us weave a few brighter
garlands for memory's sake in the remaining days
I am to be with you. We will talk of peace lest
war should send its mutterings among us; let us
anticipate love, not hate! Miss Pierson, I deputize
you to gather up the stray sunbeams for me
that memory may have a regal crown to wear
when I am far away. They elude my grasp and
always did!" he continued, bitterly. "But you
seem to be more fortunate."</p>

<p>"And I am to be left out, am I, my brother?
You do not know how expert I am in chasing butterflies
and riding on sunbeams! You may better
engage me!"</p>

<p>"I would like to have you both interested in
this benevolent work," he replied. "Still you are
aware, Ellen, that I have very little regard for
butterflies, and beg that you will not put yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to any extra trouble to procure one for me;" and
they rode on in silence for some minutes. "Ten
miles as sure as you live and we have not thought
of our lunch," he cried, a little later, as they
wheeled by the corners of a cross road. "We
must examine the hamper for good old Katie's
sake, if not for our own." Ample justice was done
to Aunt Katie's skill amid jests and laughter
while the gloomy clouds that had flecked each
heart were forgotten.</p>

<p>The station was reached at last and the four
ladies were soon snugly seated in the family coach,
while the gentlemen followed in a hired vehicle.
It was almost night when the travelers found
themselves at their journey's end.</p>

<p>The residence of the "Washburn's" was a large
ancient house, for it had been the home of the father
who had bequeathed it to the son many years
before with an abundance of hospitality and good
cheer, as our visitors were soon made to understand.
The ladies were hurried off to their warm,
comfortable rooms to prepare for dinner, which
had been waiting for "two whole hours" the
hostess had said, and now she bustled about the
dining-room to see that everything was in perfect
order and the finishing touches had been completed.
All were gathered in the parlors at last,
merry and refreshed, and as Mrs. St. Clair protested
they were dreadfully hungry after their long
cold ride.</p>

<p>"What a brilliant party!" exclaimed Mrs. Washburn,
entering at the moment to announce dinner;
"and yet, my dear Mrs. St. Clair, I have not told
you that my brother's wife, Mrs. Gaylord, is here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
from Virginia! You remember you met her two
years ago."</p>

<p>"That is good news, certainly. I did not know
that she had returned from the north, where she
went after fresh air I believe."</p>

<p>"She has an adopted daughter, a beautiful girl
who has brightened her up wonderfully. I never
saw an <i>own</i> daughter more idolized."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaylord my readers have met before; will
they also recognize the adopted daughter? She
is almost a young lady now, having been with her
new friends nearly two years, and, during the
time, received every opportunity for improvement,
not one of which had been lost. She is taller than
when we last met her, her manners winning and
graceful, while her eyes had not forgotten their
mysterious wonderings or her heart its ambitious
longings. At this home in the far south where
she had been nearly a week there was much upon
which to feed her sensibilities and awaken her
imaginings.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> go in for making money off from my plantation,"
remarked the host in reply to a suggestion
from one of the party as they seated themselves at
the table when all were at last gathered. "I long
ago learned who is king over this broad land, and
like well to do my share in keeping the crown on
his head." A hearty laugh followed when he continued:
"And if this war, which is so much
talked of just now, should really become a fact, I
reckon some others will feel his power."</p>

<p>"You must be chary of your words, sir, for we
have a northerner in our party," interposed Mrs.
Belmont, her keen eyes fixed on the face of Anna
Pierson, which crimsoned beneath her gaze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Pierson's principles, whatever they are,
must be shielded from irony or ridicule while in our
party," said George St. Clair, with some warmth,
although in a low tone of voice, intended for Mrs.
Belmont's ears only.</p>

<p>The lady was awed and silenced. She would
not for the world offend the young man, for in him
too many of her fondest hopes were still centered.
She had not for a moment given up the idea that
Lillian would, after a little sensible consideration,
accede to her wishes and recall her rejected
lover, whom she was sure only waited permission
to return.</p>

<p>The conversation soon became sprightly and animated,
but the ladies remained silent, while the
face of one, at least, expressed more than words
could utter.</p>

<p>A movement to leave the table by George St.
Clair put an end to it all, and it was not resumed
while the little party remained together.</p>

<p>Upon entering the parlor Mrs. Belmont found
herself <i>tete a tete</i> with the young lady from Virginia.
The company had gathered themselves
into little groups or pairs, and each seemed intent
upon some individual topic separate from the others,
and nothing was left for the stately lady to do
but to commence conversation with her companion
or remain moodily silent, which she felt greatly
inclined to do. However, her position required
action, and she inquired:</p>

<p>"How long have you been in Virginia? I understand
that you are an adopted daughter of Mrs.
Gaylord."</p>

<p>"That is all. I have been with her not yet two
years."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The answer was concise and gentle. Still the
deep, thoughtful eyes that had remained fixed with
their wondering look on the face of the questioner
as she spoke, disturbed the lady, and she moved
uneasily. Somehow it penetrated more deeply under
the covering of her soul than was comfortable,
but she continued:</p>

<p>"Where was your previous home, my child?"</p>

<p>"In Massachusetts."</p>

<p>"Ah, a Northerner, then?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied the interrogated with
a smile.</p>

<p>"Not know? You are an orphan I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>At almost any other time Lily would have been
indignant at such close questionings, but there
was something about the tall stately lady in black
that interested her and during the few moments
they had sat there together she had read much in
the dark face before her. Therefore, when she
was asked further: "Have you no remembrance of
a mother or of early years?" she determined to
prolong the conversation, and watch closely for a
peep beneath the mask she felt sure was there.</p>

<p>"No, I do not remember my mother, and very
little about my childhood. There are, however, a
few bright memories I have treasured on account
of their distinctness, and which will never leave
me. The rest of my life, before I was six years
of age, is but a dream."</p>

<p>The eyes of Mrs. Belmont were fixed with their
burning gaze upon the face of the speaker, and
although her heart beat more quickly and the color
deepened on her cheek, yet she did not quail or
remove her own calm look from them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little deeper," she thought, "and curiosity
will be satisfied." Ah! how little you know those
hidden depths! The bloom would die on that full
round cheek, and the light of the joyous eyes
would be quenched could their gaze penetrate
that external covering of affability. Therefore
be content.</p>

<p>"What are those memories, child? Tell me
all."</p>

<p>Lily hesitated for a moment. The command
embodied in the request disturbed her not a little,
but she silenced her heart and continued:</p>

<p>"I remember being in a small cottage by the
great ocean somewhere; I do not know where, and
of being unhappy, yet there were bright spots here
and there, standing out with such brilliancy that
the darkness seems hidden by them. I loved the
ocean, and as I learned the fact that at some time
I had been called 'Lily Pearl,' this awoke in me
most inconceivable emotions; for this reason, no
doubt, connected with a little dream that I had
lived down among the pearls, and that a beautiful
lady had picked me up from the waves&mdash;that
dream made me love the music of its waters and
long to become a part of the mighty whole. But
you are ill!"</p>

<p>She was about to spring from her seat when
an iron grasp was laid upon her shoulder and a
husky voice demanded her to "sit down!" Still
they could not remain longer unnoticed, and were
soon surrounded.</p>

<p>"The ride was too much for you," suggested the
hostess.</p>

<p>"It is sitting in such a warm room after being
out in the cold," suggested another, all of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
met with no contradiction, and excusing herself,
Mrs. Belmont retired to her private room. There
we will leave her alone with her wretchedness and
remorse. Dreary companions are they both through
the long hours of one wearisome night; but when
the morning draws near, and we find that no kind
hand for us to clasp is reached down through the
dreary shades, the gray dawn shrinks back and the
dark pall of despair drops its thick folds around
us, shutting out the glorious day beams from our
vision, while the night of the soul still goes on!
Wearisome night! full of spectral forms which
glide in and out through the darkness, bringing
from the past unwished for memories which tell
us ever of what we <i>are</i> and what we might have
been.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3><a name="THE_LITTLE_PARTY_AT_THE_WASHBURNS" id="THE_LITTLE_PARTY_AT_THE_WASHBURNS"></a>THE LITTLE PARTY AT THE WASHBURN'S.</h3>


<p>Rose, the youngest and only unmarried of the
three daughters, was not at home on the arrival of
the visitors. She came the next day, however, as
was expected.</p>

<p>"The same wild Rose as ever," the father exclaimed,
as he lifted her from the carriage and continued
to look after her, as she bounded up the
steps of the piazza, upsetting a little urchin on the
way, sending him rolling down among the shrubbery
at its foot, without stopping to heed the pitiful
cry that came up from the thick shade any
more than she did the familiar salutation of her
father. Yet this insensibility is not unusual to
that class of young ladies who have been reared
from childhood under the destroying influences of
"caste," wherever it can be found. Why should
it be otherwise? The first impression made upon
the susceptible heart is, "I am your superior;
wealth and inherited power have determined our
positions. Wealth and poverty cannot affiliate."
Thus does the cultivating of selfishness begin
which grows and expands until its hard, crooked,
knotty branches reach out and smother the more
tender plants of kindness and love, which must by
necessity droop and become wholly extinct. Yet
Rose Washburn was not wholly cruel or selfish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
She had been used to seeing the little dark forms
that sprung up everywhere all over the plantation
rolling about from accident or design. "It did
not seem to hurt them," therefore the silvery chords
of tenderness and love which ever make such sweet
music in the truly feminine heart, had ceased
to vibrate as they always do when the spirit of selfishness
rusts and corrodes them.</p>

<p>"The same wild Rose of two years ago," echoed
Mr. St. Clair, as he met her in the door, imprinting
a kiss on her cheek.</p>

<p>"I should think you would not dare touch me,
for fear of being scratched," she replied, pettishly,
as she bounded past him into the hall.</p>

<p>The young lady was not aware that Anna Pierson,
the governess, was one of the guests she was
expected to entertain, until entering the parlor a
half-hour after her arrival. It was a fact not at
all anticipated by the party themselves when the
invitation was accepted, but George St. Clair most
frankly expressed the opinion that it was a shame
to give her no pleasure during the short vacation,
and there was no reason under the sun why she
should not take the place of Bertha, who had positively
refused to accompany them, which Ellen
echoed with great earnestness. There were many
misgivings, however, in the mind of the humble
Anna as to the propriety of accepting, after
all, for she well knew that Mrs. Belmont, at least,
looked upon her with an unloving eye, and how
was she to be made sure that her presence would
not be distasteful to those they went to visit? But
Ellen laughed away every objection, declaring, "I
will not go without you; we will stay at home together."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>This, of course, was not to be thought of, and
Anna found herself happy in the assurance that,
although far from home, she was still with those
who loved her.</p>

<p>The penetrating eye of the governess saw the
sudden flash of scorn that passed over the face of
the new-comer at their introduction; nor did the
slight pressure of the finger tips betray a cordial
welcome.</p>

<p>"I am so glad to get home again!" she exclaimed
languidly, throwing herself upon the sofa. "I have
heard nothing for the last week but war, war, war!
and if I was ever tired of anything it is that hateful
subject. One thing, however, I have made up
my mind to do. If those cold blooded northerners
should presume to raise their plebeian hands against
us, you will see me shoulder my musket and go
forth to try my skill in popping over a few of
them." She rang the bell violently as the mother
replied:</p>

<p>"If I were so tired of a hateful subject I would
not again introduce it."</p>

<p>A servant girl entered.</p>

<p>"Roll the sofa up nearer the grate." Then
turning to Ellen, she continued:</p>

<p>"I feel chilly after riding. It is provokingly
cold just now. Did you suffer much from your
long journey? Miss Pierson, I suppose, is used
to such weather."</p>

<p>They decided promptly that they both had a
"lovely ride," and Rose settled herself down in
her warm seat by the fire.</p>

<p>"Where is Mrs. Belmont?" she asked a moment
after, "I have not seen her yet. The gentlemen,
I reckon, are in the library discussing the war."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother thought they were, and added that
Mrs. Belmont had gone up stairs sometime before
inviting Miss Gaylord to accompany her.</p>

<p>"She seems to have taken a great fancy to your
daughter, Mrs. Gaylord," remarked Mrs. St. Clair,
"you must be careful, or she will win her from
you."</p>

<p>"Lily does not appear at all fickle in her affections;
I think I am safe," replied the lady, smiling.</p>

<p>"Are you always so industrious, Miss Pierson?"
interrogated Rose, blandly. "I beg your pardon;
I forgot for the moment that you are from the land
of industry. As true as I live, Ellen, she has
drawn you into the same graceless habit. What is
that on the table by you? A stocking, 'pon my
word!" Ellen only laughed as she held up a portion
of a worsted scarf in process of manufacture.</p>

<p>"We plebeians do not call this work; only a little
amusement," interposed Anna, without raising
her eyes. "We awkward people find it difficult
sometimes to dispose of our hands, and so we employ
them."</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>A toss of the head and some trivial remark to
her mother was the only answer given by the
young lady addressed.</p>

<p>The door opened and lunch was announced. The
gentlemen entered soon after, and the conversation
became spirited and general.</p>

<p>One thing Rose Washburn could not understand,
she was heard to declare to Mrs. Belmont, and that
was how George St. Clair could "devote so much
time and attention to 'that menial.'" Of course it
was only his excessive gallantry, but he ought to
know that it does him no honor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Belmont fully agreed with her young
friend, yet showed no disposition to prolong the
conversation. Rose also wondered at the unusual
dignity and stateliness of the lady, and with renewed
admiration for her queenly bearing she remained
silent.</p>

<p>The dinner hour arrived at last. The bell had
just called but all were not present, and so they
waited. The host was in fine spirits. "Always
happy," as he declared, but pretty generally more
so as the day continued to advance. He was a
lover of good wine, and unless attentively watched
by his careful wife would often lose his boasted
manliness after dinner. She had determined to
use her influence during the stay of her guests to
keep him the genial gentleman she so much desired
him to be. He had, however, unknown to
her, ordered wine to the library in the morning,
but was quite sure he had been temperate in his
potations.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose they call those two
girls 'Rose' and 'Lily' for?" he asked, slapping
Mr. St. Clair on the shoulder as the bell rang
again and the party arose. "Not because their
names are appropriate; that is a fact," he continued,
after his boisterous laugh had died away.
"You never saw a lily with such black spots on it,
did you?"</p>

<p>"I have," remarked the young lady, playfully.
"You will discover that my eyes are not 'black,'
but a positive 'red brown,' as Aunt Dinah would
say. We have lilies in our garden at home with
just such colored spots on them, and we call them
'tiger lilies.' Now is not my name appropriate?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha! ha! just so. And I reckon you have
roses with terrible sharp things about them which
say as plainly as words can do, 'hands off,' haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"He-he-he, sharp-toed slippers," squeaked a
piping voice from the stairs where they were passing.</p>

<p>"Yes, and see how you like it," exclaimed Rose,
making a spring towards him, but with the sprightliness
of a squirrel he darted behind a heavy post
of the balustrades, which unfortunately for the
occupant of that dainty slipper received the full
force of the blow that was not designed for it.</p>

<p>"I like it, Missus," called back the provoking
little rascal, as he scrambled on all fours up the
broad stairway.</p>

<p>"I'll pay him off," exclaimed Rose, excited with
pain and anger. "If I was not so hungry I would
do it now."</p>

<p>The laugh became general, and to avoid further
remark the young lady joined in with them. Yet
her cheek burned and she found it difficult to
throw aside the unpleasant incident or make herself
believe that George St. Clair, who was unusually
attentive to her, did not also remember. But
the hour of feasting passed agreeably enough, and
when the ladies arose to retire, the young gentleman,
who seldom took wine, asked the privilege of
going with them. This broke up the after dinner
<i>tete a tete</i>, and they all returned to the parlor.
Anna stood by the window looking out over the
beautiful landscape, when a voice near her asked
in low tones:</p>

<p>"Are you very unhappy here, Anna?" She hesitated
a moment before answering, as she looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
into the manly face beside her. It was full of truth
and anxiety.</p>

<p>"I am very happy, and have to thank you for
my pleasure," was the quiet response.</p>

<p>"I feared I should have to crave your pardon, as
I perceive that Miss Rose does not look upon you
kindly."</p>

<p>"You may think it strange, but even this does
not give me pain; it only amuses me."</p>

<p>"That is right. I rejoice that I have not been
the means of troubling you when so much desiring
your pleasure."</p>

<p>"Do you play?" inquired Rose, coming up to
the window where the two were standing. "I
think Ellen has told me that music is one of the
branches you teach."</p>

<p>"Yes; and I play a little occasionally, as example
is more forcible than theory," was the mischievous
response. "Mr. St. Clair, however, will,
without doubt, prefer hearing you, as my attempts
would be only a story many times told."</p>

<p>George looked into the beaming face of his companion,
and his own caught the light. "She spoke
truthfully when she said she enjoyed it," he
thought, and taking the hand of the hostess' daughter,
drew her arm within his own and led her away
to the piano.</p>

<p>"Rose sings very well," remarked Mr. St. Clair
to Mrs. Belmont, who was sitting beside him on
the sofa.</p>

<p>"One more," called out the father, as the last
words of the song "Will You Sometimes Think of
Me?" died away or were swallowed up in the dense
volume of the elaborate accompaniment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would you like, Father? 'Do They Miss
Me at Home?'"</p>

<p>The remembrance of these words as sung in a
distant home brought tears into the eyes of <i>one</i> of
her listeners, as the scenes of that last night came
rolling in upon the mind, and when at last the
voice of Mr. St. Clair was heard calling: "Now,
Anna, for Cathesdra," she arose mechanically to
obey while the dew of love still glistened in her
mild blue orbs. "It is my favorite, you know,"
remarked the old gentleman, apologetically.</p>

<p>"And it is my delight to gratify you," was the
characteristic response.</p>

<p>Anna never sang better. There was something
in the wail of the poor exile pining for the scenes
of her Italian home which chimed in smoothly yet
pensively with the low sighing of her own heart,
and when the words "O let me die where my
mother died," came bubbling up from the full font
of her filial affections, a burst of applause mingled
harshly with her flute-like tones. The hand that
clasped hers as George St. Clair led her back to
the window where they had been standing some
time before, did not seem at all willing to relinquish
its task when its duty was over; and not
until he espied a smile ripple over her illumined
features did he speak.</p>

<p>"A little homesick," he remarked, quietly, and
changed the subject.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaylord always retired early, and Lily,
either from force of habit or affection, seldom failed
to sit by her to talk or read until quietly resting
for the night. That evening, as the pale face settled
itself into the snowy pillow, the young girl
stooped to kiss the weary brow as she asked:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you see anything peculiar about Mrs. Belmont?
I do not like to be prejudiced, but somehow
she strikes a chill over me every time I catch
her gaze fastened upon me; and yet there is a fascination
about her from which I find it impossible
to disentangle myself. She commands me with
the beck of her hand, while a look consigns me to
silence, and yet I have met her so recently. Can
you tell me what it all means?"</p>

<p>"You love her, my child."</p>

<p>"O no; it is not that. I almost fear her."</p>

<p>"Then she loves you."</p>

<p>"I do not think she does. For some reason I
cannot divine she seems greatly interested in my
early history. I told you of her strange conduct
last evening. To-day she inquired if I had any
idea where upon the Atlantic shore my childhood's
home had been situated; and when I answered that
I had no idea whatever, I could but notice the
gleam of joy that flashed over her face. I should
have called it satisfaction, if I had found a reason
for supposing that the attitude of indifference she
assumed was not perfectly legitimate. But I am
wearying you when you ought to be resting. All
of these are 'idle dreamings,' as Willie would say,
so good night," and with another kiss the young
girl stole noiselessly from the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaylord, however, could not sleep. It did
not seem at all like dreaming to her, and an indescribable
sensation of fearful forebodings had taken
possession of her, as one feels sure that a storm is
approaching, although far away. "But it is only
for a week," she concluded, "then she will forget it
all and rest."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Ellen St. Clair and Anna roomed together by
special request, and long that night did the two
friends lie side by side and talk.</p>

<p>"I do wonder so much," said Anna, at last
"how Mrs. Washburn could have given her love
to one so unlike herself in everything."</p>

<p>"It was strange. I have heard my mother tell
the story many times. You know <i>they</i> were very
dear friends in their school days, and have always
kept their affections warm and bright by frequent
communications and visits. If it were not for that
tie I hardly think we should be drawn here for so
long a time. But I hope you enjoy it just a little."</p>

<p>"More than that. I shall always remember you
with love for giving me this pleasure. But you
have excited my 'plebeian' curiosity regarding this
strange marriage. Will you satisfy it?"</p>

<p>"O yes. Know, then, that Mary Gaylord was
the daughter of a Virginia planter, who was very
wealthy, and fearing to send his daughter north on
account of the enmity existing between the sections,
he posted her off to Augusta, where she found a
husband who did not at all suit his taste. It was
an elopement, I believe, and after all was over it
was ascertained that the boasted wealth of the
newly made groom consisted in the <i>prospect</i> of a
few acres of pine swamp, which would probably
become altogether unproductive before it should
pass into his possession. The father, however, at
last relented, and revoked his decree to cast her off
forever, and gave them a few thousand with which
he has by dint of buying and selling amassed quite
a large fortune. This added to the estate that has
since been left him by his father, has placed him
on an equal footing with the planters of the State.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Were it not for the wealth he is supposed to possess,
Jack Washburn would hardly be tolerated in
good society. I have heard, Anna, that in your
section of country worth, not wealth, is more generally
the passport up the ascending scale."</p>

<p>"This should be true, but there is not such a
vast difference between us. The social edicts are
about the same. I often wonder how it will be
when, as the Bible tells us, there will be a new
earth, and we shall live in the society of the 'Sons
of God.'"</p>

<p>Ellen laughed.</p>

<p>"Not much like the present state of affairs, I
reckon. One thing I am sure of, there will be no
master, no slave, nor shall there be war any more.
It is dreadful to think of. Do you believe, after
all, that the north will be so foolish as to fight?
George says he is sure of it, but I hope he is not
a prophet."</p>

<p>"You, I am convinced, will pardon almost anything
in me, even if I tell you that I am of the
opinion that God has this whole matter in hand,
and will work it our according to His wise purposes.
There have been a million prayers going
up to Him for a century or more out of crushed
hearts, dripping with the bitterest tears ever shed
by human eyes, and will He not hear? Whether
there is war or not, His will be done."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Belmont would call that treason, dear
Anna, but I feel that it is true. If there is a pitying
Father anywhere He will defend and protect His
children and bring the guilty to their reward
when the proper time comes, and in my opinion the
'mistress of Rosedale' will be obliged to put her
keen eyes to a good use if she at last finds a way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to escape. But I am getting sleepy; good night,"
and in a few moments Ellen St. Clair had forgotten
the wonder she had planted in the bosom of
her companion.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DEATH_OF_UNCLE_BOB_CH" id="THE_DEATH_OF_UNCLE_BOB_CH"></a>THE DEATH OF UNCLE BOB.</h3>


<p>"There is no such thing as a trifle in the world,"
says the Spanish proverb. "When we remember
how inextricably the lives of all mankind are tangled
together, it seems as if every word and action
moved a lever which set in motion a gigantic machine
whose effect is beyond our control." Such
has been the workings of those of whom our little
history treats, and yet the labor is not completed.</p>

<p>Charles Belmont would arrive before dinner the
next day after the incidents of our last chapter, and
Ellen St. Clair was expected, of course, to be nervous
and excited; but much to the chagrin of the
mother of the young gentleman, at least, she was
neither. One might well accuse her of indifference
or disinterestedness, so calm and quiet did she
appear. It was proposed that they should ride
over to the depot to meet him, but she thought it
"tiresome."</p>

<p>"Then let us go to the village for the letters,"
suggested Rose; but even that was "unnecessary,"
and, besides, it was Jim's work, and for one she did
not "like to infringe upon the rights of others,"
she declared, with the merriest of laughs.</p>

<p>"Then," said George, coming to the rescue, "we
will take Anna out and show her the orange
groves."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is just the thing; a walk was what was
most needed."</p>

<p>"And Ellen is suited at last," exclaimed Rose,
in a pet.</p>

<p>"But you will go without me. Southern luxury is
no rarity to one who has always been used to it;"
and the insinuating eyes darted to the calm face of
her for whom the pretty speech was intended. "I
will remain within doors, and listen to the chit-chat
of the old ladies, or it may be, finish the
'Missing Bride,' which I consider far more agreeable."</p>

<p>"Do you find entertainment in the works of Mrs.
Southworth? There are those who consider them
rather effervescent&mdash;to speak mildly."</p>

<p>"Of whom you are included."</p>

<p>"Certainly so," replied George St. Clair with a
touch of irony in his voice, it must be confessed,
for he had seen the glow deepen on the cheek of
Anna too many times beneath her scathing words,
not to realize the uprising of his knightly indignation,
which submerged, for the moment, his native
gallantry. But one glance into the mirthful
face of his companion, who was already equipped
for her walk, brought to his mind her previous assertion,
that she really enjoyed it; and he smothered
the glowing fire and stepped into the hall for
his hat.</p>

<p>Lily was bathing the aching head of her suffering
mother, and could not be prevailed upon to
leave her post, and so the three started on without
her. On the piazza, however, they encountered
"Toddy," who was rolling in the sunshine and
trying to sing like Aunt Millie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, you rascal," called George, "come and
show us where we can find the store-house. I want
you to see first how they prepare and store away
the cotton," he continued, turning to Anna.</p>

<p>"Wants to see where dey works 'em?" asked
Toddy with a very knowing look.</p>

<p>"Yes, where the gins are."</p>

<p>"Yes, massa." And the boy started off in a
rollicking trot, much to the amusement of the
young people who followed close after him. On he
went, slapping his sides at every step, and casting
a sly look over his shoulder at the ladies.</p>

<p>"Here, you monkey&mdash;don't you ever walk?"
again called George, as he was getting far ahead.</p>

<p>"Yes, massa."</p>

<p>"When, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"When Miss Rose wants dis child to hurry
quick," he shouted back, at the same time bestowing
one of his side-long glances.</p>

<p>There was another merry laugh when Anna inquired:</p>

<p>"What do they call you Toddy for? It seems
like a queer name for a little boy."</p>

<p>"Don' know Missus; 'spects it's 'cause massa
likes me."</p>

<p>This was too much even for the staid bachelor,
and he joined heartily in the laugh that followed
this bit of wit.</p>

<p>"I reckon they do not give you many whippings,"
suggested Ellen.</p>

<p>"Right smart, sometimes, Missus."</p>

<p>"Where are you taking us, madcap? Here, this
is the way to the gin house."</p>

<p>"Yes, massa," and turning in the direction designated
he proceeded with the same swinging trot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
as before. "Uncle Bob drefful bad ober dar," he
added a moment after, pointing to a small cabin a
little apart from the rest. "Reckon he's goin t'
die," and he renewed with vigor the peculiar movement
of his strange gait, yet this time the drumming
of his chubby hands kept up a running accompaniment
to the song he had left unfinished
when disturbed in the attempt to imitate poor Aunt
Millie.</p>

<p>Anna did not join in the amusement of the moment,
for her thoughts were with the old man who
"was mighty bad ober dar," and she longed to
visit him in his humble home. She walked through
the extensive warehouse, listened to the explanations
regarding the work of the world-famed cotton
gin, looked at the huge piles of bales not yet
shipped, yet felt no interest in what she heard or
saw, so great had become her desire to go to the
little cabin where the poor negro was dying; and
when they again emerged into the open air, she
said, calmly:</p>

<p>"Why not make a visit to the sick now? I have
heard so much in the north about the piety and
resignation of the negro people in the dying hour
that I long to witness it for myself."</p>

<p>The young man looked into the face of the speaker
with a shadow of perplexity covering his own.
Ellen, however, quietly remarked:</p>

<p>"All of these things have been greatly exaggerated,
without doubt, and yet I shall never forget
how triumphantly old Peter went home. I was
quite small, but my heart learned a great lesson
from that death. If you desire, Anna, I will go
with you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think, ladies, you had better commission me
to carry the wine and oil, for having had one peep
into the sensitive nature of our northern friend, I
must consider you very thoughtless, my sister, in
forwarding her desires."</p>

<p>This was said with apparent carelessness, yet
Anna did not fail to perceive that he did not want
them to go. Still she was not willing to give it up,
and, laying her hand on his arm, she said, playfully:</p>

<p>"Miss Rose will require a little of your Samaritan
kindness, if she is still weeping over the tortures
of the 'Missing Bride,' and if you will pardon
us we will go to the cabin while you administer
balm in another direction. To-morrow, remember,
we are to finish our rambles through the orange
groves."</p>

<p>"Of course he will excuse us," interposed
Ellen, "we will not remain a great while." And
with a "Just as you please, ladies," their chaperon,
with a most obsequious bow, walked away.</p>

<p>"He hasn't gone to the house at all," remarked
the sister looking after him, but Toddy unperceived
by either had appeared on the scene and
with one of his knowing glances remarked quaintly:
"Miss Lily ober dar wid de turkeys; I seed her
goin' down de walk. Dis be ole Bob's," and rolling
up to the door he opened it, then stepped back
for the ladies to enter. "A little gentleman after
all," remarked Anna <i>sotto voce</i>; but they were in
the room where in the farther part lay the old man
with closed eyes apparently asleep. "Do not disturb
him," whispered Ellen approaching the bedside;
but the large eyes opened as she drew near
and a smile spread itself over the thin features.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"De young ladies from de house has come to
see you," said the girl in attendance. "Bress
ye'se honey. I'se most home, got most t'ro' wid
de work and de cryin'! Old Bob's done heaps of
dem both&mdash;bress de Lord!" And the heavy lids
drooped again over the large eyes where such a
joyous light seemed burning. Anna could not
resist the impulse to take the bony hand of the
dying man in her own, and as it lay in her warm
clasp he looked again upon her. "Does ye pray,
honey? De good Lord help ye! It's but a little
way down to de ribber whar old Bob's a-goin'!
Poo' massa! I'se told de Lord all 'bout him. It's
de liquor what keeps de good away&mdash;but den I'se
most t'ro'&mdash;goin' home&mdash;bress de Lord!" A spoon
was placed to his lips and as he swallowed the few
drops he murmured: "<i>Poo</i>' massa! It's de liquor,"
and his voice died away in a prayer Anna
was sure for his lips moved almost imperceptibly.
There was a moment's silence, then Anna as she
raised the hand she had been holding from the
feebly heaving breast asked softly: "What are
all the sorrows of life to you now? With heaven
so near can you feel sad for a moment over what
has past? Are you very happy poor, dying saint?"
O that look! "It must have been a ray that had
darted through the opening gate that so lighted
up the wan features," said Anna after, "for it was
like nothing I ever saw before." The poor girl by
his side was weeping quietly, but she caught the
glance of the heavenly eyes, and laying her hand
on the white head said soothingly: "Dar's a
crown for poor old Bob where dis head won't ache
no mo';" and the fervent "bress de Lord!" fell
again from the thin lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you not afraid to stay here alone?" whispered
Ellen.</p>

<p>"O, no; de Lord and de holy angels are close
by, and Fanny will be here when de days work is
t'ro'. But Bob an I isn't 'fraid. We'll both be
dar by and by." Fearing to intrude longer upon
the last moments of a departing soul the two stole
noiselessly from the humble room which was so
soon to prove the gate of heaven to the liberated
spirit, and they stepped out into the cool, bracing
air, yet not a word was spoken.</p>

<p>"There come the carriages from the depot,"
remarked Ellen as they turned towards the house.
Yes, Charles Belmont had arrived; as also Mr.
St. Clair, in company with the host, from where
they had been taking a drive over a neighboring
plantation; and shortly after a merry party, to all
appearance, sat down to a bountiful dinner. How
little we know of the grief, bitterness, disappointment,
anger and rage that can be crowded into one
dark chamber of the soul over which the spirit of
evil keeps its faithful watch, holding in its right
hand the keys of its secret domain!</p>

<p>"Old Bob gone dead, sure," piped a voice
through a narrow aperture of the door close to the
master's chair.</p>

<p>"<i>Get out</i> you scoundrel!" exclaimed the host,
at the same time throwing a chicken bone at the
intruder's curly head which failed in its aim, while
the gleeful "he-he-he!" mingled itself with the
sound of Toddy's rapid scrambling up the broad
staircase outside.</p>

<p>"Did you know Bob was so bad?" inquired the
wife, stopping for a moment in her duties as hostess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bad? Bob wasn't bad about anything! But I
knew he was going this morning, the old boy!
Well, he did have one fault; he loved his good-for-nothing
old master and I reckon things won't
go quite as brisk now that he has gone."</p>

<p>"One of the faithful ones, I take it?" interrogated
Charles Belmont.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a pet of my father's, who, when he
was dying, told me to be good to 'Bob' and I
reckon I've done it;" and the little ripple caused
by the departure of a human soul closed up, and
the dinner with its accompaniments of mirth and
laughter went on as though the waters had never
been stirred. Death! Mrs. Belmont retired to
her room almost immediately after the party returned
to the parlor, for a flood of contending
emotions had rolled in upon her guilty soul at the
very thought of the "king of terrors." Then, too,
there came to her through the surgings of the inward
tempest the last words of him who was sleeping
in the shadows at Rosedale, "teach the children
to be true, noble and better than we have
been, for somehow I can but feel that Aunt Vina
is right 'we must have the Lord sometime or be
wretched!'" "The Lord! Wretched! Am I
not all that now?" and the miserable woman
paced the floor as her thoughts went on. Where
was Lillian? She was to teach to be good and
noble! Under that very roof was her child! The
babe she had so desired to thrust out of sight&mdash;out
of the world! Every motion of the childish figure&mdash;every
look sent a barb of anguish to her already
tortured soul! "It will all be brought to light"
something had continually whispered to her
awakened conscience for the last two days, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
how could she ever meet it? How gladly she
would have throttled the power that was so resistlessly
carrying her forward! O the agony of a
sin-cursed soul! The stately lady stood by the
window and looked out upon the scenes before her.
Yonder were the rays of the setting sun yet lingering
in the tree-tops; near was the rude cabin
where the still form of the humble slave was lying.
How joyfully would the proud, haughty
mistress of Rosedale at that moment have exchanged
places with the poor despised menial! But
she must live; the future was unfolding itself to
her every moment and what <i>was</i> to be done?
Again the record of a mortal life was sadly closed,
for on its pages was written the guilt of a perjured
soul!</p>

<p>"It must be done!" she mentally exclaimed,
while her long slender fingers clasped each other
so tightly that the nails pressed painfully into the
flesh. "I never could live with such a tornado of
disgrace howling around me! <i>Never! It must
be done!</i>"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O what a tangled web we weave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first we practice to deceive;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>what a concourse of evil spirits will enter when
the door of the heart is thrown open to the first
invited guests!</p>

<p>The miserable occupant of the upper chamber
was realizing it all now as she had never done
before. She had flattered herself that the great
secret that was gnawing at her very life was wholly
in her power; but the fantasy was being dispelled!
Lillian was&mdash;she knew not where! Perhaps at
that very moment probing the long-concealed
mystery and if discovered would <i>hate</i> her mother!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
This was torture indeed! She halted in her walk
and stood again by the window. "I must go
down," she thought after a moments pause; "they
will wonder at my absence. Secrecy and hypocrisy
is my future work! To draw the veil of indifference
over the boiling cauldron&mdash;smother the fire
and be the gentlewoman of fashion and society!
O for a mask with which to cover it all!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3><a name="THE_ABDUCTION" id="THE_ABDUCTION"></a>THE ABDUCTION.</h3>


<p>Mrs. Gaylord did not expect to return to her
Virginia home for some time, it being her intention
to spend the winter as far south as convenient, her
physician having ordered a warmer climate and an
entire change of scene. She thought her health
was improving, and so she would remain until the
crocus peeped from its bed beneath its brown covering,
and then she would return. But it was a
pity that Lily should be shut up so closely when
there was so much in the city to give her enjoyment.
Tiny could do all her mistress really needed,
and "we will make it so pleasant for her," Ellen
pleaded; and Mrs. Belmont, who stood behind the
curtain, calm and dignified, had, unconsciously to
all, set the plan in active operation.</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall be permitted to add my mite
to the young lady's happiness, which I shall not
fail to do if she will favor us, before I leave the
city," she said quietly. All the time she was
speaking her fingers slowly turned the leaves of a
book on the table as though it was of very small
moment whether the invitation was or was not accepted,
and as the young lady left the room remarked,
quietly:</p>

<p>"I believe I have taken quite a fancy to your
daughter, Mrs. Gaylord. It seems sometimes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
she resembles in some respects my Lillian; their
eyes certainly are similar. Do you not think so,
George?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have often been reminded of her. The
same deep, thoughtful expression, and at times the
same sad look I have noticed on Lillian's face since
I returned from Europe."</p>

<p>George St. Clair did not remove his gaze from
the face before him while speaking, yet she answered
calmly:</p>

<p>"I can see no reason why one so young should
have such a look."</p>

<p>The young man bent his head almost to her ear,
as he whispered: "And there is no reason under
heaven why your daughter's face should wear it.
There is a curse in a false ambition like the one
that is blackening your soul. Unbend yourself
and do what every mother's heart should prompt
her to do. Seek your child's happiness and despise,
as every noble character will, the worldly
lust that is governing you."</p>

<p>"How dare you!" she exclaimed, rising to her
feet and fixing her keen eyes upon him. But she
said no more. The power of his calm, unflinching
gaze awed her into silence, and turning she left the
room. Yet the slumbering demon in her heart had
been aroused and as she strolled out into the open
air seemed ready to overpower her.</p>

<p>"What does he know about my false ambition?
Could she have told him? Ah, but she knew nothing
of her child; let her revelations be what they
may, this secret is not his to taunt me with. Lost,
lost! Poverty is to crush my pride after all I have
done. 'A curse!' Yes, a curse has already set its
seal upon my ambition&mdash;my life." She walked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
until calm once more stole in among her the contending
spirits, and she returned to the house.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Belmont seems like one who has experienced
some great reverse," remarked Mrs. Gaylord,
after her abrupt departure from the parlor.
"I have noticed several times since she has been
here a disquietude perfectly unaccountable in one
of her position."</p>

<p>The young man made a casual reply, and others
entering at the moment the little incident was
seemingly forgotten.</p>

<p>"It has been decided," remarked Ellen to her
brother the next morning; "Lily Gaylord will return
with us, and Anna seems delighted. I had
not thought until last evening that a tie of native
land drew them together."</p>

<p>"A land of very favorable productions," replied
the brother, with a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>During the short visit the war excitement was
spreading wider and wider, and its symptoms became
more and more positive. In the cities the
alarm raged like an epidemic in certain circles,
while there were a few who denounced the whole
affair, a cooling draught quite inefficient to keep
down the devouring fever. Great preparations were
being made in Charleston, and a few other places
were following its lead, so that, should the campaign
really open in the spring, as was prophesied,
they might be ready. Mr. St. Clair was one
of the number who thought it not well to go to
fighting. "To be sure," he would say, good-naturedly,
"Uncle Sam is getting rather plethoric, and
it may be well to give him a little fright," but
he never would advocate the idea of the breaking
up of households. "No doubt it would be a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
fine thing to tumble down the old national structure
after it was done we were sure of walking in over
the ruins and building up to suit our own notions."
But to tell the truth he was a little afraid of the
old giant. He had learned that his locks might
grow again, crop them ever so short. The safest
way, he thought, was to let well enough alone.</p>

<p>His son was much of the same opinion, but if
the house must be divided against itself he would
not let it fall into ruin without a struggle. Therefore,
in a few days after the little party had returned
to the city, George St. Clair started for
Charleston. Lily was in ecstacy as they drew
near Savannah. The sea, the great glorious sea,
was before her, and the music of its distant waves
thrilled every fibre of her being. It recalled the
fancied dream of her childhood when she longed
to go out and lay her head on the billows and become
a part of its restless life.</p>

<p>Charles Belmont, who had gone to the city a few
days before, was at the St. Clair's on their arrival
and gave them a hearty welcome. Had he thought
that little Phebe, as the adopted daughter of the
wealthy Virginia planter, would do to reign at
Rosedale?</p>

<p>A long programme was soon made out for the
pleasures of the next few weeks. There were
rides and public entertainments, select dinner parties
and little <i>tete a tete's</i>, besides one grand, brilliant
soiree at the senator's mansion which Lily
must not fail to attend!</p>

<p>"It is so lucky that Charles Belmont has not
left us," remarked Ellen while talking it all over.
"He is a most graceful <i>chaperon</i> and it stands us
in hand to court his favor. You will not refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
him, Lily?" she continued with an arch smile.
"He seems well pleased to be called into service."
Thus the weeks passed away. The violets peered
out from their beds of green along the garden
borders and the daffodils turned their broad faces
to the sun, and yet Mr. Gaylord did not come
south after his wife. He was in Richmond with
the leading men of the day discussing the great
topics under consideration, while Mrs. Gaylord
grew weary with her long visit and more and more
nervous with its daily protraction. After much
urging and earnest solicitation by her friends she
consented to follow Lily to the city, and she soon
found herself forgetting, when once the guest of
Mrs. St. Clair, that the time had hung heavily.
The widowed Bertha became much attached to the
pale little visitor, and found great consolation
in pouring her sorrows into her attentive ear. One
day she came abruptly into the room where Mrs.
Gaylord was sitting alone and saw tears upon her
cheeks still undried. "Then you too grieve sometimes,"
she remarked, laying her white hand
affectionately on the bowed head. "How true it
is that we find shadows where we should least expect
them! But then it must be sad never to feel
well!"</p>

<p>"O no, dear; it is not that! I seldom if ever
have wept because of physical suffering. I consider
my pains and aches an indispensable part of
the programme of life. We all need a certain
amount of refining in order to ascertain how much
gold will remain, if any; therefore I bear all this
because there is wisdom in it and an end to be
accomplished."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"One would scarcely imagine that you could
have a greater reason for sorrow."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, and yet I surprised you with
tears. Shall I tell you why? No idle fancy of
mine but only a few innocent lines, the product,
no doubt, of an experience similar to my own.
Let me read them to you. 'We cannot judge of
what the heart contains by the laughter that
escapes the lips or the smiles that flit across and
illumine the face, any more than we can fathom
the soundless deep or discover the contents of its
dark chambers by the sunbeams that lie upon its
surface. A crown of diamonds and precious stones
is a thing of beauty, but when lined with thorns
and pressed down by its heavy weight of wealth on
the pierced and bleeding temples it will lose its
preciousness as it becomes a crown of torture!
Thus many blessings, priceless in themselves,
may become our greatest source of misery if a
cruel hand twines thorns among them. Our most
serious wounds are those that no eye can discover
because of their depth.' May you not realize all
this Mrs. Mason. <i>I</i> know it! This is the reason
why your words, dropped one by one into the fountain
of my soul, create such a melancholy echo!"</p>

<p>"I confess that I am astonished. Rich, talented
and beloved; how can there be such pitiful wailings
in your poor heart? Were I expecting my
husband as you are yours, or had he died where
his last words could have been breathed into my
ear I think I could hush every other saddened
echo and call myself happy. But to have the light
of life suddenly blown out, and with a great shock
find yourself in total darkness, covers the heart
with a pall hard to remove. Then to feel through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the whole night that it need not have been! O&mdash;you
never can know! '<i>The code of honor!</i>' My
soul detests such chivalry!" and the bright eyes
glared wildly into the face of her companion.</p>

<p>"My poor friend! The tenderest sympathies
of my heart are yours! I am ashamed of my
weakness; and yet there are many avenues to the
soul through which the bitter waters flow. One of
these, it may be, is the closing up of those through
which the real practical benefits are expected to
enter, leaving room only for the unreal and the
unpractical. Here I feel is my fault. It is this
binding up of my whole being with these silver
cords, upon which every external incident has a
power like the touch of electricity to fill my whole
soul with discord. In my youth I very foolishly
drew my own panorama of coming events, in which
I left out everything that was rough or unsightly;
in a word, filling up the future with ideal loveliness.
I thought my life's path would soon begin
to wind along through the valley of roses where
no harsh winds ever blow and no dark shadows
ever shut out the glowing sunlight. But the time
when my slippered feet were to tread on thornless
flowers has not arrived. I ought to be ashamed
of myself ever to have expected it. It is not in
my power to disjoint my nature and reconstruct
it with iron! That I was so organized is my misfortune,
not my crime!"</p>

<p>"Does all this make you unhappy? It seems
to me that a nature so full of beauty or what you
term 'unrealities' ought to have a source of joy
all its own."</p>

<p>"If one could live to herself it might be so;
but it is for the practical that we were created, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
this we are chosen. Fail in the power of bestowal
and verily we are guilty of the whole. I am a
failure! It is my mission to sow dew-drops where
wheat should have been scattered, to covet sunbeams
when clouds are more to the purpose! It
is not pleasant, surely, to awaken after a gentle
nap of self-repose to find that a grave has been
dug with your 'incapacities' which has swallowed
up the love you once fondly expected would gild
a whole life with roseate hues!"</p>

<p>"<i>Love you?</i> Why everyone loves <i>you</i>! Your
husband idolizes you! Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Go look at my wardrobe; is anything deficient
there? My jewels&mdash;are they not the richest and
rarest? But with it all my woman's heart is still
unsatisfied. Ah, there is Lily; I hear her coming
up the stairs. She has, the foolish child, the same
wild longings, the same idealities that goad me. It
was these that woke my heart to her cry for love."</p>

<p>Lily came bounding into the room her cheeks
and eyes bright with the excitement of her morning
ride.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry you did not go with us," she said
as she kissed the pale lips of her dearest friend.
"I am sure it would have taken all of the pain out
of your head, the air is so pure and sweet. Besides
Charles is to return to Rosedale to-morrow where
his mother will follow in a few days, and Ellen
will not trust herself with the new coachman, he
is so easily frightened, the horses are so spirited;
and Mrs. Belmont is almost as bad. She says she
really believes he would jump from the box and
run if they should put up their ears a little higher
than usual. But you shall have one more ride,
and if he deserts his post I will take it. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
would be only the exercise of one of my early accomplishments.
Dear old Rover," she continued,
half to herself. Where was Willie? Frequent
letters assured her that he was doing nicely in his
new vocation, while her constant memories of him
added to his content as new prospects opened before
him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmont insisted that Lily should spend
one day at least with her before leaving the city,
and as Mr. Gaylord was expected soon her request
was speedily granted.</p>

<p>"We are to have a drive along the beach," Lily
went on to say, "returning just as the moon rises.
I wish we were to have a larger party, but it was
not spoken of until yesterday. It will be delightful
I know! Already I feel the uprising of that
childhood's memory when I used to steal away to
look at the moon as it lay on the water and wished
I could go where it was."</p>

<p>It was a delightful evening as the little party
started for their pleasant ride with the scent of
far-off flowers coming to them on the soft wings of
the southern breeze and the music of the great
ocean in their ears. Into this the bright day-king
was about to take his nightly plunge from behind
the royal colors of purple and gold.</p>

<p>"What a little enthusiast you are about the
ocean!" remarked Mrs. Belmont in response to
some exclamation of admiration. "Perhaps you
would like to take another such a ride upon it as
you told me of?"</p>

<p>"I do not think I should be more afraid now
than I then was if I were on those rose-colored
waves yonder rocking and rolling as they are
doing. I believe I should still imagine that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
voice of my mother was mingled with their song
lulling me to sleep!" Lily did not notice the
agitation of her companion or perceive that her
lips were of an ashy hue and her cheeks sunken
and pale, so much engrossed was she in the excitement
of the scene about her.</p>

<p>"Turn to the right here," commanded Mrs. Belmont.</p>

<p>"Lor! Lor, Missus! <i>Dat</i> road?"</p>

<p>"Turn to the right and keep silent!" she repeated.</p>

<p>"This <i>does</i> seem like an unfrequented path leading
into the woods," remarked Lily without any
seeming agitation.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; I am going to take you around a
little then come down abruptly to the beach. I
have been here and understand the way perfectly."</p>

<p>"Have we come a long way?"</p>

<p>"Only a few miles." Both were again silent.</p>

<p>"How soon it gets dark after the sun goes
down," said Lily a few moments after. "May we
not better think of returning?"</p>

<p>"Presently. There, take to the left now, it
will bring us around to the beach."</p>

<p>Sam made no objection to the command this
time, but his shoulders evinced unmistakable signs
of inward dissatisfaction as he turned the horses into
the road which was narrow and half overgrown
with grass. Soon they came to a thickly-wooded
elevation, when Mrs. Belmont commanded that
they should halt! "We must turn to the left
again here in order to gain the main road; but I
want to show you, dear, more of the ocean than
you ever saw before at one view. We will walk a
little way&mdash;to the opening yonder, while you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
remain here with the carriage, Sam, until we return."</p>

<p>"It's <i>drefful</i> dark, Missus! Sam don't like it
nohow!"</p>

<p>"I am very much of Sam's opinion," remarked
Lily who had alighted. "The moon will be up
in a few moments; besides, it is these trees that
make it so dark here!" Once more on firm footing
the fearlessness and buoyancy of her nature
returned to her, and the young girl darted away
toward the spot designated with a light and rapid
step.</p>

<p>"Do not leave me to grope my way alone,"
called Mrs. Belmont.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon and will stand here and
wait for you," came the reply. "I have not gained
the light yet, but it is a little way ahead; come!"
She waited for a moment as she had said, and
hearing a step on the right called out: "This way
Mrs. Belmont; where are you?"</p>

<p>At this moment a pair of strong arms were
thrown about her and a voice hissed in her ear:
"Don't ye bawl, and ye shan't be hurt! I'se got
a strong grip and so ye'd better be quiet!" She
gave one shriek, and then finding he had bound
her hands while speaking shouted again the name
of "Mrs. Belmont!" Quick as thought a bandage
was thrust over her mouth which almost suffocated
her. "Thar, thar&mdash;I reckon yese'll be quiet
now!" and taking her in his powerful grasp bore
her rapidly away.</p>

<p>"Sam! Sam!" screamed Mrs. Belmont; "come
quickly! Do you not hear the dear child calling?
Something has happened! Run and find her!"
She was close to the carriage and there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
need of calling so loudly; but the poor, frightened
negro did not move.</p>

<p>"<i>Why do you not run?</i>"</p>

<p>"O Lor, Lor, Missus! Dis nigger can't do
nothin'! I'se mighty 'fraid, Missus! Can't go
nohow!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmont wrung her hands in the very
abandonment of grief! "Poor, poor girl!" Then
darting into the woods she called with a loud
voice: "Lily! Lily!" But the roaring of the
waves not far away was her only answer. After
many exclamations of sorrow and outbursts of
grief; after much calling and many remonstrances
with the poor frightened negro for his good-for-nothingness
on <i>all</i> occasions, and this trying one
in particular, Mrs. Belmont reseated herself in the
carriage and commanded that Sam should drive as
rapidly as possible to the city.</p>

<p>"Dat I will, Missus; but what ye do wid di
young lady?"</p>

<p>"Drive to the city as I command you!" was the
emphatic answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Missus;" and after some hesitation and
audible ejaculations from Sam they gained the
highway and an hour after drove up to the door
of the St. Clair's.</p>

<p>"What the deuce does this mean!" exclaimed
the old gentleman as Mrs. Belmont entered the
parlor with haggard looks and her long black hair
in disorder about her face. The sad story was
soon told amid sobs and exclamations from her
hearers.</p>

<p>"What possessed you to remain down to the
beach at such a late hour?" interrogated Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
St. Clair angrily. "One could almost suspect
you of design."</p>

<p>"My dear husband," said the wife; "do not be
too rash! The question is, what can we do for the
poor girl?"</p>

<p>"Send to headquarters of the police immediately!
The place must be thoroughly searched
by moonlight and continued until she is found!"</p>

<p>All this time Mrs. Belmont sat like one who
had suddenly lost the power of motion, while her
keen, dark eyes seemed to burn the carpet at her
feet. At last she arose and with the dignity of
former days walked from the room, and her carriage
was soon after heard rolling away from the
door.</p>

<p>"You have offended your cousin Mr. St. Clair,"
said the wife.</p>

<p>"I do not care if I have! She had no business
to be out in such a place without being better attended
at any rate!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gaylord must not hear of this to-night,"
continued the good lady musingly as her husband
left the room. "How can I tell her! It is terrible!"</p>

<p>Day after day was the search continued but
with no success. Mrs. Belmont had closed her
doors against all visitors, taking the precaution,
however, to station her servants where they would
be able to bring her the first news concerning the
missing one. Mr. Gaylord reached Savannah in
time to join in the search and administer consolation
to his newly-afflicted wife.</p>

<p>Let the human soul wander where it will with
its burden of guilt; let it try as best it can to hide
its deformity under the covering of complacency,
the eye that never slumbers is upon it and an accusing
conscience will continue to repeat "thy sin
shall find thee out!" Poor Mrs. Belmont! Step
by step had she been led forward on the path where
she little expected to walk, but in her stepping
down from true womanhood she had been met by
the spirit of evil and he had guided her tremblingly
on.</p>

<p>The third evening after the close of our last
chapter a tall figure in feminine attire might have
been seen in the street opposite her residence. A
half hour after, the side door of that house opened
softly and closed again as a closely-veiled woman
emerged into the darkness. Passing down the
main avenue it came to a street more unfrequented
where the two met and walked on together a few
moments in silence. At last stopping suddenly
the voice of Mrs. Belmont inquired in a subdued
tone, "Well&mdash;what are you going to say? <i>Quick!</i>"</p>

<p>"I'se goin' to tell ye. I took the gal down to
the boat, but 'twas a mighty hard tug. She didn't
make no fuss tho', so I took off the handkerchief
and told her to be aisy and I'd treat her well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Then came lots of questions but I didn't tell her
nothin'. The sea was mighty high and I know'd
there was no gettin' to the ship, so I jest hugged
the shore as near as I dast to 'til I got away where
nobody could find us, then I pulled up where I
know'd was good shelter to wait for the tide, when
gorry! I'd no more than sot foot on a hard rock
than the gal sprung to her feet and was off quick
as a wink! How she got her hands untied
nobody knows! But she couldn't ha' kept up five
minutes for the wind was risin' and the waves was
<i>awful</i>, so I reckon there's no more trouble for
nobody!"</p>

<p>"You are a blunderer!" gasped his listener.</p>

<p>"I'se done my best, that's all!"</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;take that&mdash;and remember next week
you go to Charleston as a volunteer to fight, and
if you get shot so much the better for you! This
is the bounty to be given your family! Go&mdash;and
let me and this transaction die from your memory
forever! <i>Go!</i>"</p>

<p>They separated and Mrs. Belmont returned to
her home with the same stealthy tread as that
with which she had left it. Alone in her chamber
the wretched woman listened once more long and
helplessly to the terrible upbraidings of conscience!</p>

<p>"I did not intend all this," she cried. "O, no!
The stain of <i>murder</i> cannot be found on my soul!
I only thought&mdash;the great Judge knows I would
never have injured my own flesh and blood! The
great Judge!" she repeated, while a tremor ran
through her frame. "Yes, He knows I did not
mean all this! I was compelled&mdash;having taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the first step there was no retreating! Ah, that
first act! Whither will it lead me?"</p>

<p>In the morning the storm had passed and Mrs.
Belmont came forth to light and life more rigid
and stern than before. It was said that "her sorrows
had made her grave; yet more grand and
dignified," and soon the "presumptuous" whispers
of blame were hushed, for one so <i>noble</i> as the
"mistress of Rosedale" <i>could not</i> be guilty of
crime! And the wave of public opinion closed
over the scene and the waters of social life were
calm again.</p>

<p>George St. Clair had remained in Charleston
during these excitements, watching the progress of
other scenes even more sad and cruel, yet free
from the plague spots of crime, and bearing aloft
the banner held to be of glory and honor for the
reason that a nation, not an individual, had demanded
the sacrifice of many lives, not one!
South Carolina had drawn her ample robes more
closely about her and with one pitiful leap had
plunged over the fearful precipice down into the
dark and unexplored depths of the yawning chasm
of disunion, dragging after her a few of her unfortunate
sisters. No wonder they stood and
trembled upon the brink when it was once reached,
for there were mysteries wholly unlooked for
which seemed to lose their golden tints upon
nearer approach and assume the dignity of practical
realities. The little "affair" at Fort Sumter
somehow had cast a shadow of foreboding over
more than one chivalric heart.</p>

<p>Col. St. Clair met his commanding officer the
morning after the surrender of the little half-starved
garrison, standing alone viewing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
his glass the noble fort with the new emblem of
glory floating over it.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;how do you like the looks of that,
Colonel? The Morning Star with <i>healing</i> in its
beams&mdash;ha?" Taking down his glass he turned
to his companion, who had not yet spoken, and
continued; "what the deuce is the matter with you
St. Clair? Your face ought to be shining with
victory, but instead it presents a perfect blank!"</p>

<p>"As unreadable as our future," he replied with
an attempt at a smile.</p>

<p>"Ah! A discovery! Getting tired already!
Hope the white feather has not began to grow as
soon as this!" There was a sneer on the face of
the speaker which his companion did not fail to
notice.</p>

<p>"General," he said mildly, "I acknowledge with
deference your superiority in military rank, but do
not forget that the blood of the St. Clair's runs
through my veins, disseminating through my
being no mean cowardice, as you well know!"
The general laughed.</p>

<p>"You are awake now my brave boy and more
like yourself! I only wanted to arouse you! Now
tell us, what is the matter? Something more than
our surroundings disturbs you. Out with it!"</p>

<p>"What time do the Eaton's go north?" was the
calm inquiry.</p>

<p>"Next Wednesday in the steamer from New
Orleans," the general replied in the same indifferent
tone.</p>

<p>Another short silence ensued when St. Clair
again remarked: "We have won such a victory
that we can afford to rest for a time, I suppose?
The fact is, general," he continued, "I have received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
a telegram this morning that has disturbed
me not a little!"</p>

<p>"I am glad your ill humor can be accounted
for. I never saw you appear so unlike yourself;
no bad news I hope!"</p>

<p>The manner of his companion was particularly
offensive just then, but smothering his rage St.
Clair replied: "You understand that I would like
a furlough to return home for a few days! It
seems that my father must leave Savannah, where
he has been an honored and beloved citizen for
nearly half a century, or forfeit his life, for no other
reason than that he cannot at his advanced age
learn immediately the act of dissembling nor tear
from his heart the live-long love for the old flag."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, St. Clair?"</p>

<p>"I mean just <i>this</i>! My father was fired upon
last night while sitting quietly in his own library,
the ball passing a little above his head and lodged
in the wall opposite."</p>

<p>The general was excited. "A blood-thirsty
<i>wretch</i>!" escaped from his lips, while his companion
continued calmly: "In order to save our
loved ones we must push them off into the enemy's
country; now honestly, general, has not that
a smack of the ridiculous about it?" Without
waiting for a reply he turned, remarking: "It is
time that I was at work if I am permitted to go on
the next train."</p>

<p>Anna Pierson was alone in the school room, her
head bowed upon the desk before which she was
sitting. A sheet of letter paper with a few lines
written upon it was lying beside her, while the
idle pen with the ink dried upon it had apparently
fallen on the page blearing and spoiling it. Poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Anna! She had sat there a long time silent and
motionless, seemingly unconscious even when little
May stole softly into the room to tell "Miss
Anna" that Uncle George had come; she was
obliged to run back with the intelligence that
Miss Anna was asleep; neither did the tread of
heavier feet arouse her when nearly half an hour
later George St. Clair quietly pushed back the
half-open door and stood irresolutely for a moment
on the threshold. She was not asleep as he well
knew, for a low, deep sigh reached him, and the
little hand that hung so listlessly over the corner
of the desk on which her head was resting
trembled. In a moment he was beside her, and
taking the bowed head between his hands he
raised it tenderly and looked down into the tear-stained
face.</p>

<p>"Anna!"</p>

<p>"George St. Clair!" she exclaimed with almost
a shriek, at the same time attempting to rise. But
he held her fast.</p>

<p>"No, Anna! It takes a longer time than you
have given me to get a perfect daguerreotype! I
want the memory of this just as I found it, tear-stained
and all! It is no more than I deserve. I
should not have been so cruelly selfish as not to
have told you weeks ago to leave Savannah and
return to your northern home."</p>

<p>"Is it too late now?"</p>

<p>"No, but you must be speedy! More than this,
you must take my father and mother and Ellen
with you!"</p>

<p>"With me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Anna; we cannot leave them here after
what has happened."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, no; I shall be so happy! But George&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, Anna?"</p>

<p>"My mother is a widow in humble circumstances&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you imagine that I would burden yourself
or your mother?"</p>

<p>"Not that," she interrupted. "I was only
thinking of the change from a home of luxury to
one of only comfort, yet very peaceful and dear, at
least to me. But it would be delightful if I could
make them as happy and joyous in <i>my</i> humble
home as they have made me in theirs. Will they
let me try?"</p>

<p>"Has no one but the three you have mentioned
added a morsel to your enjoyment since you have
been an inmate of this home?"</p>

<p>The blood rushed to her cheeks and brow and
she struggled to liberate herself that he might not
look so intently down into her swimming eyes,
which she well knew would tell him more than
she would have him know.</p>

<p>"Then there was no one else! Well&mdash;take
them; I will consign them to your care until the
detestable struggle is over! When this is done I
will relieve you. Bertha is a true rebel and will
have no fears in remaining where she is."</p>

<p>The voice of the speaker was low and tremulous
as he uttered these words, and Anna thought that
she had never before seen his face so pale and thin.
He had permitted her to rise and she now stood
before him. Did she love him? She had asked
herself that question many months previously, and
although her lips were prompt in their denial her
heart had remained silent. It throbbed now as
she met his troubled gaze and beheld the look of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
sorrow on his face. It was for a moment only.
For the first time her eyes fell upon his military
dress; it was a rebel uniform! A flood of recollections
rolled in upon her in deadly combat. Would
that hand which had so lately touched her cheek
spill the life-blood of those who were so dear to
her? The thought sent the blood back to her
heart and left cheek and lip pallid and cold! With
an involuntary shudder she laid her trembling
hand on his shoulder and tried to speak, but the
words died on her pale lips. George St. Clair
passed his arm about her and drew her to a seat on
the sofa. "You are ill; sit here until I procure
some water!"</p>

<p>"No, no; I am not ill; it is over now. You came
to talk to me about going home. It is very kind
of you;" and, rising, she extended her hand. He
took it tenderly in his as she continued: "I joyfully
accept the charge you have placed in my care,
and will endeavor to be to them all you could wish;
and now, before our last farewell, make me one
promise, will you." Her lips quivered, but with
an effort she thrust back the tears that were welling
up from her full heart, while her hand lay
motionless in his. "It is this: Should one or both
of my brothers, through the fickleness of war, be
thrown into your power, that you will let the memories
of the last eighteen months soften your heart
with mercy toward them."</p>

<p>"Has this uniform converted me into a monster?
I do not wonder? Yet I promise you all
and more! God only knows what those memories
of which you speak will do with me. Now we will
go and talk the departure over with the rest, yet
not with that pale face, Anna. It would add a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
pang to the sorrows of my parents, who are now
unhappy with the prospects of expulsion, as they
term it. Have you not one kind word for me now
that we are so soon to part, perhaps never to meet
again? O, Anna, I had torn from my life's history
several pages which I had determined to read
to you to-day, but cannot now." He raised her
hand to his lips. "Farewell! we will go. To-morrow,
no doubt, you will be busy; the next day
we must be in Charleston to intercept a New Orleans
steamer going north. This route will be a little
longer but more agreeable, as every train is thoroughly
searched for any who may be going thither
with more information concerning our plans than
would be desirable. Again farewell." He dropped
her hand and left the room.</p>

<p>Anna sank down again on the sofa, and for a few
moments gave vent to her pent-up tears. The succeeding
day was full of sadness and bustle. Many
tears were shed, and presentiments indulged in.
The invincible Bertha alone stood firm and apparently
unmoved. Only once did the son and brother
appear with the family. He came to dinner, but
disappeared as soon as it was over. Anna tried to
think of her home, where she would soon be, of
the joy of her fond mother at the reunion, but it
was piercing the cloud to draw the sunshine from
beyond.</p>

<p>In one week the little party arrived safely in
Washington; from there they took the cars for
Baltimore, and thence to New York.</p>

<p>A few miles back from the noble old Hudson
stands a pleasant little village, nestled in among
the green hills and wide-spreading trees, cosy and
quiet, excepting where the rapid stream comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
rushing down through the valley, turning in its
course two huge splashing wheels that never grow
weary as they keep on with their work, propelling
the machinery of the massive cotton mills which
were the life and pride of the inhabitants for many
miles around. It looked calm and peaceful as seen
from the deck of the steamer, where Anna was sitting,
and her heart bounded with ecstacy as the
pleasant remembrances of her home life came sweeping
over her. She had been sitting with the hand
of Ellen St. Clair clasped tightly in her own, apparently
listening to her exclamations of delight
at the grand scenery through which they were
passing, while in truth she was harkening to other
voices that came up from the past, and gazing on
the many sweet faces that filled her heart with a
new joy, and drew back for a while the dark curtains
that seemed to hang between her and the
shadowed future.</p>

<p>"I declare, I do not believe you have heard one
word I have been saying." This from Ellen at
last. "All of that ecstasy is wasted; and I indulge
in it so seldom! Tell me, Anna, what were
you thinking about?"</p>

<p>"Of home, dear Ellen, and how happy we will
all be together."</p>

<p>"But Father thinks we may better take rooms at
the hotel; he is afraid."</p>

<p>"I understand all. They will be better acquainted
with our habits soon, and, it may be, will
think more leniently of us; but I am responsible
for your safe-keeping, you know, and could not
think of extending my care over more than a mile
to the hotel." Anna smiled, while Ellen's laugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
reached the parents who were sitting some distance
from them.</p>

<p>"They are happy, wife," suggested Mr. St.
Clair, "and I reckon we might as well be so too,
and make the best of circumstances."</p>

<p>The little circle in the widow's cottage would
have been happy, yes joyous, had there not
been two vacant chairs at the evening gatherings
and at the morning devotions, while the sound of
war came to them from the distance, telling of
bloodshed, of anguish, of heart-strings breaking
and homes made desolate forever. It was sad; but
the widow never ceased to pray, and with her petitions
there went up a meed of praise that He had
given her the power to offer, on the altar of sacrifice,
her first born, with his brother, both true and noble.</p>

<p>Colonel St. Clair's letters were frequent, and
although full of love and solicitude for his parents
and Ellen, he had never more than casually mentioned
the name of Anna in any of them. But his
sister was with her and she was happy. Having
never herself known the love of a sister, she fancied
that in this dear friend she had at last found
a recompense for her years of unsatisfied longing.
Milton has said "The happiness of a nation consists
in true religious piety, justice, prudence, temperance,
fortitude, and the contempt of avarice and
ambition; they in whom these virtues dwell eminently
need not kings to make them happy; but
are the architects of their own happiness, and
whether to themselves or others are not less than
kings." And we add, the country who has these
virtues and lives upon the principles emanating
therefrom needs not war to wipe out injustice and
wrong.</p>

<h3><a name="LEADING_HER_ON" id="LEADING_HER_ON"></a>LEADING HER ON.</h3>


<p>The path downward is easy of descent, even
though the end thereof be eternal ruin! There
were thousands at the time of which we are writing
(as well as in all stages of human life) who
threw themselves from the lofty pinnacle of true
nobility to grovel awhile in the slough of wickedness,
then perish forever! How terrible must be
the awakening of such a soul, if the kind Ruler
should ever permit the awakening to come, and
yet worse, sadly worse, would be the unconscious
sleep that plunges its victim over the precipice of
ruin to be aroused at last beyond the boundaries
of hope!</p>

<p>One night after the first signal defeat of the
southern army, which seemed to dim for awhile
the bright halo of victory that had darted up the
horizon from northern skies, a circle of ladies were
gathered in a spacious parlor in Charleston, doubtless
for business purposes, and those of no ordinary
character, if we should judge by the earnest debates
that were carried on in one corner by a
group apart from the rest, or by the sage countenances
and serious deportment of the others.</p>

<p>One of the number, a tall lady in black, had
arisen from her seat on the sofa, where she had
been discussing for a long time some important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
subject in which all appeared particularly interested,
and was now walking with measured
tread and folded arms up and down the long parlors,
seemingly unconscious of the low buzz of
subdued voices which fell on her ear at every turn,
for her dark, keen eyes had never once been raised
from the carpet on which she was treading.</p>

<p>Just outside of the window stood a large magnolia
tree whose upper branches reached the narrow
opening made by letting down the window to
admit the fragrant air from the blossoms outside.
To-night this had not been neglected, and as the
heavy lace curtains were pushed slightly to one
side a pair of dark, wondering eyes peered down
upon the scene below. In the kitchen another
group had gathered; their faces were darker and
their clothing coarser and homelier than those
upon which the slave boy was gazing from his
elevated seat in the magnolia tree, but the all-absorbing
subject had fired the blood and quickened
the pulse alike of each. Harry had
determined to learn as much as possible about the
excitement, and his heart had beat rapidly as he
listened to much that had been said by those who
had occupied the sofa directly under the window;
but he could hear little now and he waited impatiently
for the return of the principal speaker
who provokingly continued her thoughtful promenade.
He was thinking of the light, frail mulatto
girl down stairs who was nervously waiting for
his appearance and the new secret he was to confide
in her; and the half hour seemed to extend to
an interminable length.</p>

<p>It ended at last. The tall figure reseated itself
in the chair, and the eager face of the listener<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
pressed hard to the frame of the window that his
ear might not lose a word.</p>

<p>"Yes; <i>I will go!</i>" were the first that reached
him.</p>

<p>"You have decided nobly!" exclaimed several
in a breath.</p>

<p>"It is just what I knew you would do after deliberating
upon it!" replied the one who seemed
to be particularly addressed. "You are so much
better fitted for the mission than any one present!
Your queenly bearing and imperious manners
would command the confidence and respect of
strangers. Then your acquaintance in Washington
would so materially assist you! It has been
proven that our army must act with skill as well
as power, and as the colonel says, 'we <i>must</i> learn
something of their plans before they are brought
against us, if we are to overthrow them.' For this
you are well adapted as you will have no trouble
in mingling with the most refined, or in select circles
where such things are ably discussed." Mrs.
Belmont had been sitting during this speech
seemingly absorbed in her meditations, but the
listener outside lost not a word.</p>

<p>"You will disguise yourself in some way, I suppose,"
suggested another. Mrs. Belmont aroused
herself at this.</p>

<p>"I will take one hundred dollars only of the
money subscribed, and will return to this house
one week from to-day without a card and my name
shall be 'Mrs. Southey.' If Harry does not recognize
me I shall feel secure. His keen eyes and
quick perceptions would penetrate my mask I
know if it could be done. I intend it shall be
complete, but this shall be my test!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>An approving hum went round the circle. "But
supposing he <i>should</i> know you?" suggested the
mistress. "I fear that half-blooded rascal&mdash;he
knows altogether too much if I can read aright the
merry twinkle in his eyes and the inquiring look
with which he scrutinizes every stranger who
visits here. But we will try him. We must not
shrink from any imaginary ill when you are to
risk so much for our good," continued the lady.</p>

<p>Harry gave a low chuckle as he thought,
"Neber you fear dis chile; he won't know nothin'
dis time su' as de worl'! Jus' you watch his eye
when Mrs.&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;what de name; well, 'twant
Belmont, dat's sartin! He-he&mdash;reckon dis 'half-blood
rascal' got 'nuf dis time!" And the nimble
figure scrambled noiselessly down to the ground
and darted away to find Nelly who was anxiously
waiting for him.</p>

<p>"O Harry!" she exclaimed as he caught her in
his arms; "I was <i>so</i> 'feared you'd be wanted! I
heard de bell ring and de ladies are agoin'!"</p>

<p>"Let 'em go, Nelly; you'll be a lady some day
jes' as good as any on 'em! I heered lots and
we's goin' t' be free! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>"O Harry, hush; somebody'll hear ye, sartin'."</p>

<p>"Oh I could yell jus' like de sojers! Hurrah!
But dis chile's got to wait; de good time's
comin', Nelly, de good time's comin'; but dar's de
bell&mdash;dat means dis rascal, su'," and away the light
figure bounded, leaping up two steps at once as he
proceeded to the upper hall where some ladies
were standing ready to take their departure.</p>

<p>"Where were you, boy, to make Mrs. Belmont
wait so long? I rang twice," exclaimed the mistress,
as he came slowly into their presence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Spects I must 'a' fell asleep Missus. Didn't hear
only dis once."</p>

<p>"You had better keep awake another time. Now
hand the ladies to their carriages, and see if you
cannot be as polite as your young master would be
if he were here." There was a hearty laugh as the
servant opened the door, bowing most obsequiously
as several passed out before him, he following to
do the honors of the "young gentleman."</p>

<p>At the appointed time Mrs. Belmont appeared
at the door of her friend, and was ushered into the
parlor by the facetious Harry, who bowed as unconcernedly
as the lady herself could desire. Upon
extending his hand for the card he was supposed
to expect, she said, blandly: "Tell your mistress
that Mrs. Southey is waiting for her;" and bowing
low the servant left the room to obey her command.
On the staircase he halted to perform several
ludicrous gyrations, while the merry twinkle
in his eyes laughed itself out, and when he reached
his lady's private boudoir they told no tale of inward
excitement.</p>

<p>"Mis' Southey is a waitin', Missus." The sharp
eyes of the mistress were upon him, but he remained
unmoved, whistling a few low notes at the
same time beating a subdued tattoo upon the door.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Southey?" repeated the lady, without removing
her gaze, but not a muscle moved in the
face she was scanning.</p>

<p>"Tell her to come to me," she continued, and
the servant departed. Great would have been the
chagrin of the mistress had she seen the humble
slave boy as he descended to the parlor below.
Catching a glimpse of Nelly at the farther end of
the long hall, he threw himself into the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
laughable contortions, which provoked in her
convulsive chuckles at the same time adding
a reproof by a dubious shake of the head. In a
few moments more the door closed behind Mrs.
Belmont as she entered her friend's room and the
two were alone together.</p>

<p>"I am sure he had not the least idea who you
were, and no wonder! I do not believe I should
recognize you myself if we should meet on the
street;" remarked the lady as her visitor seated
herself. "How strangely you look in that gray
traveling suit!"</p>

<p>"Not more so to you than to myself;" was the
low reply.</p>

<p>"Your hair put back so plainly, and those
glasses, have really added half a score to your
years. No one will doubt your origin, or that you
are an English lady of the old school." The
speaker laughed merrily, but the visitor remained
calm and silent, having been led by her companion
far away into the future where new scenes and new
duties awaited her. It was a perilous task she
had undertaken, and no one understood it better
than herself. But the last few years had been fitting
her for the risks she were to encounter.</p>

<p>"It was true that no one within the circle of my
acquaintances was so well fitted to act this part in
the great drama of war," was her conclusion, and
no one had such a reason for hating the foe as had
she, and while she was performing this great service
for her country she could at the same time pay
off the debt of her blighted hopes. During the
short visit quite another scene was being enacted
below stairs. Harry and Nelly were standing together
in one corner of the large kitchen engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
in close conversation, notwithstanding the protestations
of Aunt Nancy, who reiterated a dozen
times a day at least the declaration "Dat boy Harry
don't arn de salt in his porridge." For once her
words rattled away in the air and fell unheeded on
the ears they were aimed at.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Nell," said the slave, "dar's somethin'
goin' t' happen jes suits dis chap. We'll
have a fine house all our own, and some little
Sambo to take care ob de chilerns, and, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go away, you Harry," and the girl slapped his
round cheek, with a yellow hand that delighted to
push back the curtains hanging about her future
as well as did her lover.</p>

<p>"Well, I hearn 'em talk, and old Ben sang 'de
Good Time's Comin', louder last Sabba-day dan he
eber did afore. It's comin' Nell. I jes thought&mdash;I'll
tell Ben, and set him praying for it. He'll make
it all right, sartin, sure; and when we get de big
house we'll take old Ben to mind de chilerns.
He'll like dat for pay, sartin." Nelly laughed, and
declared again that Aunt Nancy wanted her, then
darted away, followed by the laugh of her lover.</p>

<p>Three weeks after Mrs. Belmont arrived safely
in Washington. In due time she took up her lodging
with the family whom she had known several
years previously, and who well understood her
mission in the city.</p>

<p>As the "wealthy English lady who had fled from
the South on account of her anti-war principles,"
she was admitted to the most private circles, where
she promulgated her "abolition" doctrines to the
evident satisfaction of her numerous admirers.
It did seem a very strange thing that the anticipated
movements of the Union army should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
known to the enemy long before they were brought
to maturity. But had the puzzled authorities seen
the tall gentleman who came leisurely up the long
avenue three times a week until he reached the
farther end, where he would look carelessly about
him, and stopping under a certain tree take from
beneath a stone a folded paper, then walk as slowly
on, they would have easily imagined that in this
was the mystery concealed. Yet it would have required
a great amount of credulity to believe that
Mrs. Southey, who had so won the hearts of the
people, could have possibly known of, much less
have written, those mysterious epistles. Only once
did her large eyes lose their determined look, or
the crimson wave of self reproach roll over her
stern face, but the calm face of our noble President,
as he held her hand in his, scrutinizing her
face, brought them both to view. Did those penetrating
eyes pierce the mask she was wearing?
Did that manly soul discover the spirit of rebellion
looking out through those orbs that so shrank
back at his gaze? It was only for a moment. He
bowed while the old smile returned to his plain
face as he extended his hand to the next visitor.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln sleeps to-day in a martyr's
grave, but the touch of his warm hand, without
one stain of human blood upon it, and that look
from those reproachful eyes, so full of love and
good will to all, sank with a heavy weight down
into the traitor's heart that night and were living,
real things to the wretched woman, who lived to
mourn over the sin of treachery, not only to her
country but her home-loves. Alas! that any
should think to subdue the tempest of remorse
which comes to beat upon it, by prevarication or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
crime. The eye of justice cannot be deceived.
Did these thoughts sometimes come to the miserable
woman, who tossed upon her bed as the memories
from the past came back to torment her?
Where was her child? Her Lillian? It had been
many months since she had heard from her directly,
and there were times when the terrible presentiment
of coming disgrace would haunt her
dreams and fill her waking moments with dread.
The war&mdash;the terrible war! Her son was probably
in it, surrounded with the dangers of a common
soldier. George St. Clair was in it. The mighty
wave of devastation was rolling southward, and
Rosedale was cut off from her approach, perhaps
forever. Where was the end to be? What wonder
that she trembled at every report of aggression
or conflict that sped towards her! But worse
than all this was the terrible consciousness that
sin had stained her soul with blood. Never for a
moment did the awakened conscience cease its upbraidings.
In vain did she answer back: "Say
not this of me. Murder is <i>not</i> one of my transgressions.
I did <i>not</i> mean all that!"</p>

<p>But the voice would not be silenced.</p>

<p>On almost every breeze came the sounds of conflicts
or victories, or defeats, or mournings and heart-breakings,
which chimed harshly with the shouts
of exultations and cheers of the conquering hosts.
On every breeze went up also to the great Father
and God of battles the wail of anguish, the cry
for mercy from breaking hearts, as well as the earnest
plea for protection for loved ones in the perils
of war; and the gentle spirit whispered to the
despairing soul, "What I do ye know not now,
but ye shall know." Blessed comforter! What
could be done with all the mysteries of life that
continually creep about us to chill and paralyze our
being were it not for its peaceful influences? But
let us return to glance at the terrible battle of Bull
Run, which sent dismay into thousands of homes
where the dearest ties of love were severed and the
strongest links of earth broken forever. Let history
paint the dark cloud that hung over the
blood-stained field, casting their sombre shadows
on the lonely graves of the early sacrificed.</p>

<p>There was much wondering in high circles how
the plan of attack was so well known to the opposite
forces, which would have ceased could they
have looked in upon the "wealthy English lady"
for a moment, who with her hostess, was waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
for their private messenger who was expected every
moment with the latest news from the seat of conflict,
which was to assure them that the Union army
was defeated. The dignity of the mistress of
Rosedale was for the time laid aside while she reveled
in the very abandonment of her exuberant
joy.</p>

<p>"This pays me after all for the risks I have
run," she exclaimed with a toss of her regal head.
"Wondering eyes will flash to-day, and aching
hearts exult. I have been waiting for this. The
hour of vengeance never loses itself though the
whole world should turn over in wholesale confusion."</p>

<p>"Do not, Mrs. Southey!" pleaded her companion,
"for it seems even to me that there is a sure
prophecy in your words. Vengeance! Will it
hunt us out at last?"</p>

<p>"Hush! I was not speaking of such minor
facts as ourselves. The prophecy, as you term it,
only incidentally bubbled up with the shouts of
victory; that was all." But the stern face paled
perceptibly as she uttered these careless words.</p>

<p>"It may be well to shout, still I advise you not
to be too highly elated, for remember the reports
are not all in yet, and I am in possession of a few
drawbacks as to the final results. By the way, did
you notice the remark of that senator last night
about traitors and spies? I looked up to see if you
experienced any peculiar sensations about the
throat."</p>

<p>"Did I show any signs of suffocation?"</p>

<p>"I did not perceive it."</p>

<p>"Then your look was not very penetrating. I
hope all of my friends will be equally considerate."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you did feel a little uncomfortable?"</p>

<p>"Only for a moment. I might, of course, make
a misstep that would slightly disarrange my mask,
and it would, as you know, be uncomfortable to
have curious eyes peering beneath it, and the possibility,
at times, causes a little unpleasantness."
A smile played feebly across the face of the speaker,
which soon died away, leaving cheek and brow
a shade paler than before. No doubt her soul had
taken another peep through the rifted curtain
that was shutting out her future, and beheld something
that must have appalled her. And what
wonder? "The way of the transgressor is hard."</p>

<p>"I have been thinking," continued the other
lady, after a long pause, "that we must follow the
noble example of the patriotic ladies of Washington
and visit the hospitals. We might do great
good there. Kindly hearts and willing hands will,
without doubt, be in great demand on the present
occasion. As for me, I am anxious to be about
the work," and she turned to the window.</p>

<p>"A grand thought, and shows conclusively that
you have remarkable diplomatic powers, altogether
unlooked for in our sex. I shall be ready
to follow your lead in such a noble suggestion at
our earliest convenience; but it will never do to go
empty-handed. The poor fellows will need many
things. If we are to be ministering angels, you
know, we must take the oil and wine."</p>

<p>How different from all this were the feelings and
aspirations of the little group gathered together in
the widow's cottage on the banks of the grand old
Hudson. Three days after the above conversation
in Washington, Anna Pierson returned from the
village post-office, as was her custom, bearing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
her hand several papers, which were distributed as
usual.</p>

<p>"No letters, Mother," was the prompt reply to
the anxious, inquiring look as she entered. "It
is not time, unless they were written immediately,
and we should not expect that."</p>

<p>Her words were cheerful, for she had carefully
prepared them during her walk; but her heart was
troubled with fearful apprehensions, and she dared
not consult one of those silent messengers that
were clasped so tightly in her hand until she had
entered her own room and seated herself by the
window. Then she cast her eyes over the long
columns: "The Great Battle! From our own
Correspondent." Why did she not read further?
She had longed all day for that very article, and
now that it was before her, her eyes turned towards
the clouds in the west as though her thoughts
were all centered within their shadowy folds. Ah,
there are many hearts to-day wherein these sad
memories still linger. <i>They</i> could tell why Anna
Pierson did not read, why she shrank from the terrible
revelations that might be before her. There
were many names included in the correspondent's
letter over which her eyes hurriedly ran.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" Fell from her lips as she reached
the end of the list without seeing a familiar name;
but below was a P. S.:</p>

<p>"I have just learned that Col. St. Clair of the
Confederate army has been brought into our lines
dangerously wounded."</p>

<p>The paper dropped upon the floor beside her as
she sat silent and motionless among the falling
shadows, until a timid rap on the door startled
her. In a moment Ellen entered, and without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
word threw herself at Anna's feet, and, hiding her
face in her companion's dress, wept aloud. An
arm stole softly about her neck and a hand
smoothed caressingly the dark braids of her hair.</p>

<p>"Don't, O don't, dear Ellen," she said; "let us
talk together. I have been a full half-hour coming
to a conclusion regarding my duty in this terrible
crisis. Listen, now, while I tell you my determination."
These words of love were so gentle and
kind, and her voice so full of sympathy, that Ellen
soon found herself soothed and comforted under
their tender influences.</p>

<p>"Yes, Anna, do tell me, for I was never at such
a loss regarding my own duty as now, and perhaps
your decision may aid me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will. Well, it is this: I am going
to him. He will need tender care, and I will bestow
it. You, dear girl, must take my place here;
will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Anna, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No matter; you know I was to give you my
matured decision, so do not imagine that it is possible
for me to waver."</p>

<p>"Your mother, Anna; what will she say?"</p>

<p>"She will not hinder me. But I shall expect
you to be a daughter to her as well as to your own
parents. All will need you to cheer them during
my absence. I shall place them in your care with
the full faith that all will be well."</p>

<p>"I cannot understand you, Anna. I came here
faint and trembling at the very thought of his sufferings,
to find you all ready to go to his relief,
willing to sacrifice home for only a friend, while I,
his sister, had not supposed such a thing possible."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only a friend." Was this true? Could sympathy
alone have compelled such a sacrifice?
Memories of other days came stealing in upon her
senses like sweet odors from a far-off land, but she
thrust them aside, and kissing the upturned face
before her, said, smilingly:</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear; perhaps you will know me
better some day. You are, however, mistaken in
thinking me all ready, for I shall be obliged to
wait until Monday to finish my preparations. I
shall gather a few luxuries with many little things
that I feel I shall require; so let us go to work
and banish present sorrow with busy hands."</p>

<p>True to her purpose, in three days Anna
emerged from her baptism of benedictions and
farewells, and, laden with endearing messages and
tokens of love for the suffering one, stepped on
board the "Vanderbilt," that was to bear her forward
on her chosen errand of mercy. Numerous
and varied were the emotions that took possession
of her heart as, when alone seated on the deck of
the noble steamer, she found time at last for calm
reflection. Would she find him alive? And
would he be glad to see her? Then came stealing
into her thoughts the unwelcome fact, like the
whisperings of the serpent in the garden of
flowers: "He is a rebel!" The suggestions ran on;
"will it be possible to minister to the necessities
of one like him without incurring censure? A
<i>rebel</i>!" Tears came to her eyes. She had taken
no time for weeping since the sad news reached
her, but now she gave free vent to them although
knowing that curious eyes were upon her. But
sorrow was no uncommon spectacle in those days
of bereavement and heart-breakings. Then came
a thought as softly as steals the soft sunbeam that
dries up the summer rain: "My brothers are safe;
his hand is powerless now to do them harm. Who
knows but he will cease to contend for a cause he
has not loved; to struggle for a victory his heart
never desired."</p>

<p>One who had not looked on the scenes in a hospital
after a battle, has no idea of the soul-depressing
sights that everywhere present themselves.
So thought Anna who, after two days of restlessness
and anxiety in Washington, at last obtained
permission to go to Alexandria where she was
most needed. While standing among the dead and
dying, what wonder that her cheeks paled and her
eyes were filled with tears of pity? It was where
new accessions were almost continually being made
of such as had not previously been able to be
moved from the field-tents and private houses
where they had been carried. The poor sufferers
were brought in upon stretchers or blankets and
laid on the floor, waiting for their wounds to be
examined, or the stumps of amputated limbs to be
redressed, and weather-beaten bodies to be made
more comfortable generally; before being taken
to the next ward, where nice clean beds were
waiting them. Just before her a young man with
dark brown hair and deep blue eyes was lying on
a mattress where two men had placed him. One
leg was gone, and a blood-stained bandage was
about his forehead. How pale and wan he looked!
His gaze was upon her, and his lips moved. In a
moment she was beside him. "Water," was all
she could make out. Here was work; why should
she be looking for any other? She placed the cup
to his lips and raised his head tenderly while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
drank. A cup of cold water! How sweet were
the blessings that came in upon her soul as she
gave it to him! "Thank you," and a feeble smile
came to his lips.</p>

<p>"Will you take this basin and wash some of
their hands and faces?" asked a cheery voice near
her. "I will get another. Poor fellows; they
sadly need soap and water before clean clothing
can be put on them."</p>

<p>It was a kind, sympathizing face into which she
looked while listening to the request, and although
she hesitated to commence so strange a task, it was
but for a moment. There was a world of thankfulness
in the blue eyes that looked into hers as she
took away the blood-stained bandage and smoothed
back the dark locks from the brow while she
bathed and cooled it with a soft, gentle hand.</p>

<p>"You are so kind," he murmured at last; "God
bless you."</p>

<p>"He does," was the quiet answer, and the mild
eyes closed, but not to sleep.</p>

<p>"Do you suffer much?" she asked as she laid
the hand she had been washing back on the heaving
breast.</p>

<p>"Not much; yet I shall not live. My mother,
O my mother!" A tear escaped from beneath the
closed lids and dropped down upon the hard pillow.
Anna saw it as she turned to leave and stopped to
wipe it away. "I will see you again," she whispered
and then passed on.</p>

<p>A burly son of Erin was lying near with an arm
missing and a foot thickly bandaged. With an
encouraging smile from the nurse who was engaged
in administering to one who might have
been his brother, Anna bared her arms to the work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall I try to improve your appearance a little?"
she asked, at the same time kneeling beside
him.</p>

<p>"Holy Vargin bless ye, Miss," he ejaculated.
"It's not the likes of ye's who should be doin' it;
but the Son of Mary will bless ye, Miss. Look
yonder," he continued, "d'ye see that gray-back
in the corner there? He's a reb; ye's wont wash
his face, sure?"</p>

<p>"Certainly we will," replied Anna, who could
not help smiling at the eagerness of her questioner.
"The Bible tells us to 'do good to them
that despitefully use us.' I have no doubt his face
needs washing as much as yours, and should I not
do it?"</p>

<p>"Faith and I'd put lots of soap in his eyes, and
wash up instead of down, if I did it at all, at all."</p>

<p>The girl sighed as she tugged away at the worn
out boot that seemed unwilling to yield to her powers,
but it came off at last, and with elevated nostrils
she continued her labor of mercy. While
thus engaged she looked occasionally towards the
rebel coat in the corner; but it was not he for
whom she had been anxiously searching, yet her
heart did not fail to upbraid her for an apparent
neglect. She had inquired as often as she thought
judicious, but had learned nothing. "Perhaps he
will soon be brought in," she thought, and her
eyes turned searchingly upon every new-comer.
Close by was one who had just finished his mortal
sufferings, and beyond another so still that one
might have thought him dead; but as Anna laid
her hand upon his forehead he opened his eyes
and looked at her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The surgeons were busy with their work, and
all day her hands were never idle. Three times
had she received the last words of love from pallid
lips for loved ones far away, and each time had
promised to send their precious remembrances or
tokens of undying affection from the lost whom
they never in life would look upon again; and no
wonder that at last she should return to her lodgings
weary and sick at heart!</p>

<p>"I fear I have kept you waiting," she said as
she passed her landlady in the hall; "but I have
been very busy."</p>

<p>"I understand it; how worn-out you must be!
Katy is in the kitchen keeping a cup of tea for
you," and with a thankful heart Anna proceeded
thither followed by the lady.</p>

<p>"I hope you will pardon me," she continued,
"but a soldier has been almost thrust upon me
to-day, and I have been obliged to change your
room. I was sure you would forgive me after you
knew all. He is an officer whom the general did
not like to take to the hospital, as it would not be
very pleasant for him, being a prisoner from the
Confederate army."</p>

<p>"A Confederate?" queried Anna, with some agitation.
"Do you know his name?"</p>

<p>"Colonel St. Clair. Why, my dear girl, how
strangely you look! Is he a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"He is. Is he severely wounded?"</p>

<p>"Badly, I believe, yet I do not know how.
Would you like to see him to-night?"</p>

<p>"No, unless he needs my services."</p>

<p>"I think he was sleeping when I came down.
The surgeon was here an hour ago, and his negro
servant is with him now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I will not disturb him. In the morning
I will go."</p>

<p>Anna Pierson forgot her weariness as she seated
herself with her writing desk to finish up her
day's toils by penning the promised letters of
sympathy and condolence to the friends of those
who had that day entered the silent land where
there would be no more war; and when all was
finished thoughts of home, and loved ones waiting
there, came and she wrote on, closing with the
promise to finish on the morrow after she had seen
him whom she came to seek. And then she slept.</p>

<p>Before the night had gathered up all its dark
shadows there came a low rap on her door which
aroused her, and, springing from her bed, wondered
how she could have slept so long. Mrs.
Howard entered.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to awake you so soon," she said,
"but he seems so anxious to have you come to
him, that I could not well wait longer. I told
him there was a lady here to see him, but would
not tell him your name. He appears a little
brighter this morning, and says he rested pretty
well," she continued. "Shall I tell him you are
coming?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in just a minute; for you know it does
not take us Yankee girls long to dress," she responded,
assuming a playfulness she did not at all
feel. True to her word, however, in a marvelously
short time she opened the door of the sick man's
chamber softly and closed it again as noiselessly
behind her. His face was turned towards the
wall, and he did not move until she stood beside
him. Softly laying her hand on his she whispered
his name, "George St. Clair." A sudden flush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of joy overspread his face as his fingers closed
tightly over hers, while the response, "Anna, my
good angel, how came you here?" burst from his
lips. "How glad I am that I have not on that
hated uniform. You will not despise me now?
But tell me first how came you here?"</p>

<p>"Just as any one would who had not wings to
fly; but my mission is to take care of you until
you get well."</p>

<p>"I am unworthy. But talk to me of loved ones,
of yourself, of everything."</p>

<p>A pleasant hour followed, and both were happier
than they had been for many a day. Clouds
were rising that were to cover the calm blue of
the clear sky above them, but they saw them not.</p>

<p>How kind in the Father to deal out his chastenings
as he does his blessings, one by one, else the
poor heart could not bear them!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3><a name="THE_DARK_DARK_WAVE" id="THE_DARK_DARK_WAVE"></a>THE DARK, DARK WAVE.</h3>


<p>"Anna." It was a faint, tremulous voice that
called through the half-open door of the wounded
man's chamber, as the young girl was passing;
but it was sufficiently clear to arrest her progress,
and she stood still for a moment, listening and
wondering that she should be called at such a time.
The surgeon was in attendance, as was his custom,
although the hour was an early one, he being, as
St. Clair had told her, an old friend and traveling
companion in Europe a few years before, which
accounted without doubt for his unusual attention
at such a busy time. Anna had not met him during
the few days she had been in the house as her
services had not been required during his visits,
wherefore her surprise at now hearing her name.
While thinking the matter over the call was repeated,
and without farther hesitation she hastened
to him. The wounded man was lying on his side,
partly supported by his servant, whose tears of
sympathy were rapidly flowing. The surgeon was
bending over the prostrate form with face unmoved,
probing and dressing the fearful wound.
In a moment Anna was kneeling by the drooping
head which hung faintly down on the side of the
bed, and, with a sudden impulse of feeling, raised
it tenderly to her shoulder and pressed her lips on
his cold, damp forehead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor George," she whispered, as she smoothed
back his dark hair, "it is very hard. How sorry I
am for you."</p>

<p>"I can bear it all now, and more if need be,"
and the strained eyes which looked up into the
pale anxious face bore testimony to his words.</p>

<p>"It is hard to suffer with no loving hand to
wipe the drops of agony from the brow, but endurable
when fond lips kiss them away. Dear
girl!" he added, in a whisper, just as the surgeon
finished his work, bidding the servant to lay him
down gently upon the pillow. When this was
done he turned, and apparently for the first time
discovered that another had joined their number.</p>

<p>"There, my good fellow," he remarked, cheerfully,
"I hope you will not be obliged to go
through that operation again. It is healing nicely;
and if we can keep the inflammation down and the
wound open under the shoulder-blade for a few
days, the best results may be hoped for. The
trouble is, St. Clair, you have too many chicken-hearted
ones to care for you. Your servant must
be more thorough." While making this remark
his eyes were fixed intently on the face of Anna.</p>

<p>"Miss Pierson, doctor," said St. Clair, with an
attempt to a formal introduction, "and let me tell
you, she would never be worthy of the slur you
have just cast. Should you tell her to perform
your most disagreeable commands, I feel positive
they would be carried out to the very letter."</p>

<p>"You are welcome to try me," said Anna.</p>

<p>"Can I trust you?"</p>

<p>"I came for that very purpose."</p>

<p>"Then listen." Whereupon followed a long
list of commands and injunctions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will perceive he has also a fever, which
must be kept in subjection, not only by strictly administering
the medicines but by shielding him
from every excitement. I may not be here again
for two or three days, but shall feel comparatively
easy now that I can leave him in your hands."</p>

<p>"I shall endeavor to do my duty, as far as I am
able, sir."</p>

<p>"I believe you; good morning."</p>

<p>And, taking the hand of each, the busy doctor
left the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Howard met him in the hall below to inquire
about the patient.</p>

<p>"Did I understand that young lady's name was
Pierson?" he asked, as he was about to depart.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Has she any friends in the army?"</p>

<p>"She has two brothers, she told me."</p>

<p>"Then one of them was buried yesterday. I
was sure of it as soon as I looked into her face.
They were very much alike. Poor fellow! I
found him near the rebel colonel up stairs, and
the long exposure hastened his death."</p>

<p>Again the surgeon bowed and hurried away.</p>

<p>The kind-hearted old lady stood for a moment
stupefied with pity and perplexity.</p>

<p>"It was too bad he did not tell her," she thought
as she looked after him. Her mind wandered off
to the widow on the banks of the Hudson of whom
Anna had spoken. She, too, was a widow, and had
a son in the Confederate army. It was hard for
her that he was there, but how heart-rending if he
should die far away and be buried in an unknown
grave! Could she break the sad intelligence to
the bereaved girl? The colonel needed her. Should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
she advise her to do what her sympathizing heart
prompted? She pondered it over for a few minutes,
and then her decision was taken. She hastened
up the stairway and rapped gently at the
door. It was opened immediately by Anna.</p>

<p>"I would like to see you for a short time," she
said, as the happy face beamed upon her.</p>

<p>"I will come soon," and turning to the bed she
remarked: "You must sleep now after such an
expenditure of nerve power;" and arranging the
pillows that the head might more readily rest she
placed her hand on the smooth white forehead as
she pressed her lips to his.</p>

<p>"I can sleep sweetly now, good angel, since the
old scorn has been taken out of my memory!" and
he settled quietly down.</p>

<p>"Scorn! One like poor me bestowing such a
commodity on one like you?" and laughing she
turned to leave.</p>

<p>"It may be that attribute is not in your nature,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the uniform," suggested Anna. "Well;
you are never to play the 'wolf' again, you
know?"</p>

<p>"Never, no <i>never</i>!" With a joyous step she
tripped from the room to join Mrs. Howard below
stairs.</p>

<p>"I have some sad news for you&mdash;perhaps I
ought not at such a time as this trouble you, but
my conscience would upbraid me should I keep it
to myself; besides, you must know it sometime."</p>

<p>"O, <i>do</i> tell me!" interrupted Anna impatiently.</p>

<p>"I will! You have told me of your brothers
and that you had found on inquiry that both were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
uninjured. Nothing is easier than such mistakes
in these times."</p>

<p>"Mistake? Was I mistaken? Are they not
safe?"</p>

<p>"I have heard only about one. He was found
on the battle field not far from the colonel upstairs.
Both had been exposed so long to the
rains that your brother could not rally and he
died and was buried yesterday!"</p>

<p>"<i>Died?</i> Are you <i>sure</i> he died? It <i>cannot</i> be!
Where was he?" Anna did not weep; such a
flood of thought and feeling rushed in upon her
brain that it forced back the tears. More than a
week had she been in Washington and Alexandria
while he had been suffering and dying! O, <i>why</i>
could she not have found him&mdash;listened to his
last words and received his last blessing? Ah&mdash;this
was a cold wave that was dashing over her
soul; but there was one to come more chilling,
more furious and overwhelming even than this!
"They were together!" Could it be that those
hands that had so lately clasped hers as she listened
to words of love were stained with her
brother's blood? They were opponents and found
near to each other when the conflict was over!
<i>Enemies!</i> O how these thoughts maddened her!
They seemed to tear her very <i>soul</i>! She remained
motionless and silent so long that Mrs. Howard
ventured to say:</p>

<p>"It may be you would like to find out where
he died and where they have buried him? You
can, perhaps, procure his body and take it home
for interment. This would be a great consolation
to his poor mother I am sure; I know it would be
to me!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Those words, "home" and "mother," opened
the secret avenue to her soul, and tears came
plentifully to her relief. "O, yes!" she sobbed,
after a moment's pause; "I will go immediately!
I have much to do and must not waste my time in
weeping; but it is so horrible! How will my
mother endure it?" Again the tears came, but
with repeated efforts she drove them back and
arose to leave the room. "I will leave my patient
with you," she stopped to say. "I have no doubt
you can do all that is required; at any rate I must
go! Do everything for him in your power and be
sure you will be amply rewarded. When he inquires
for me tell him the sad story; will you?
I go to bury my brother by the side of his father,
and where loving hands can care for and protect
his grave! He <i>can not</i> rest here!"</p>

<p>Her companion looked at her in surprise. Her
form was erect and firm; her eyes sparkled with
the fire of heroism! In half an hour Anna came
from her chamber prepared for a walk. She told
her friend that she was going first to the telegraph
office and then to the hospital to learn what she
could for her mother's sake! "Ellen must come to
take my place by her brother's side," she concluded.
"But must I see him no more? It is hard!
But the <i>stained hand</i>! My brother's blood!" How
much agony can be crowded into a phantom
thought! Poor Anna! Then whispered her
heart: "He may die! To agitate him might
bring very serious consequences;" she had drawn
this from the words of the surgeon. "Ellen must
soothe and comfort him;" and she hastened on her
errand of love. In a few hours she had done all
she could, and was seated in her room, weary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
heart-sore, to think over the incidents of the morning.</p>

<p>How full the moments had been crowded! In
her hand she was holding the locket that was his,
in which was her own and her mother's pictures the
kind nurse had promised to send to them. How
precious it would always be to her! His last look
of earth was on their faces; his last words were
blessings implored for them. She had learned it
all from the kind one who had bent over him at
that moment when his noble spirit winged its way
from the poor mangled body towards the land of
peace and rest. "How kind in her to be so explicit!
How soothing were the tears of sympathy
that fell from a stranger's eyes!" Then her
thoughts returned to the living. How was he?
Had he wished for her? Was he very unhappy
without her? Could she ever meet him again?
What should she do? What was her duty? O
the buffetings of a tempest-tossed soul!</p>

<p>Poor Anna; there was an undefined longing in
her heart she did not then understand, and so was
left to grieve as one who had no hope! It was a
fearful struggle between heart and judgment as
she supposed, and <i>who</i> should settle it at last? An
answer to the morning's telegram was brought in;
"Ellen will be here in three days," she concluded
after reading it, "and then I shall be at liberty to
return home with my dead!" Home! There was a
sacredness in that word now&mdash;a sad solemnity
that oppressed the heart as she remembered the
sombre emblems of bereavement that were darkening
it! There had been only the shadows of
separations in the loving circle for many years,
and even these had been lighted up with the bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
gildings of hopeful reunion! How would that
mother bear the first great blow dealt by the
crimson hand of war? Where was Elmore? They
had told her that he was probably safe and had
been hurried away with his regiment, but might
be wounded or a prisoner.</p>

<p>"How he will miss the absent one!" she
thought. The mother, it was true, had laid her
two sons upon the altar of sacrifice, but never had
failed morning or evening to plead that the fire
might not fall and consume them. One had been
taken; and the shadow from the dark-winged angel
would settle heavily down upon the widow's peaceful,
quiet home! Tears fell fast. She was so
happy a few hours ago, now how dark life seemed
to her. How fickle are our joys and what a little
breath will sometimes blow them out! Strange
that clouds should follow so closely in the wake of
the summer's sun! Lights and shadows; calms
and storms; hopes and despairs make up the individual
lives.</p>

<p>Troubled child! Why did she not in her perplexity
turn her face towards the source of all
wisdom and grace? Why do not you, gentle
reader? Her eyes were steadfastly fixed on the
ground where the shadows always lie the thickest,
rather than with the penetrating vision of faith endeavoring
to pierce the sombre clouds above her
head. The sound of footsteps along the hall
aroused her. "Some one is going to <i>his</i> room. His
room!" And the shadows clustered more closely
about her heart! It was so sad that the great
phantom which had appeared the first time when
George St. Clair stood before her in the uniform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of the confederate army should come to her now
with such an air of certainty!</p>

<p>"They were found together!" She had dreamed
of this; she had started from her sleep at seeing
that hand which pressed her cheek while he read
the secrets of her fluttering heart, stained with the
blood of his victim, and that victim her idolized
brother! It had come at last, and O, how terrible
the realization! Rising hastily she replaced her
bonnet and hurried from the room. On the stairs
she met Mrs. Howard.</p>

<p>"Colonel St. Clair is very anxious you should
come to him," she said; "and seems distressed
that you do not. He told me to bear to you his
deepest sympathy, and I saw a tear in his eye as
he told me. Will you not go to him to-day, Miss
Pierson? I think his fever is a little higher this
afternoon. Do not refuse, for I fear it will do him
harm."</p>

<p>A sudden faintness came over her as she listened
to these pleadings, and she trembled so violently
that she was obliged to seat herself for a
moment. At last with great effort she said:
"Take to him my thanks for the sympathy he
sent me, and if I can by any means bind up the
main artery of my heart that I feel has been
severed I will see him again;" and without
another word she arose and hastened from the
house.</p>

<p>"Is the child crazy?" muttered Mrs. Howard as
she proceeded up the stairway. "She has changed
fearfully during the last few hours, that is certain!"
And this she told the wounded man when
he anxiously inquired for her a few minutes after.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>A groan escaped him, but he only added, "Poor
Anna! The scourge! O the terrible scourge of
war!"</p>

<p>All the afternoon the sad mourner flitted restlessly
about among the suffering and dying,
speaking a gentle word to one, or administering a
soothing draught to another&mdash;ever active, carrying
consolation and comfort wherever she went. At
last she missed the one in whom she had previously
taken such a great interest&mdash;the young
soldier with dark-brown hair and deep blue eyes.
"Where is he?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He died last night," answered the kind old
nurse.</p>

<p>"Died?" interrogated Anna, "I thought he was
getting well."</p>

<p>"We thought he was, but God knew best!" and
the kindly lips quivered that were so used to
words of consolation.</p>

<p>"More sad hearts!" mused Anna as she became
attracted by another scene not far away from where
they were standing. A mother had just arrived
and now sat by the bed of her dying son, who for
the first time, it may be, failed to recognize the
soft touch of that gentle hand, or respond to the
familiar tones of a mother's loving voice. Too
late! He would never look upon her again! The
tempest-tossed soul forgot its own tribulations as
she watched the anguish of the stricken parent
who sat beside her boy with tearless eyes, but
with cheek and brow as white as those she was so
hopefully gazing upon, pleading for "one word,
only one word!" But it came not. Anna turned
away. "These scenes are too painful for me to-day,"
she said to the sympathizing nurse, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
softly touched her arm to recall her. "Tell me
where I can go and find peace!"</p>

<p>"I will, poor child, follow me." In the next
ward a young man was lying, his face livid from
the loss of blood, one limb entirely gone, the other
partially, yet a smile shone ever upon those wan
features, and his kindly greeting and words of
cheerfulness were like rays of sunshine to all who
came under their influences. "Mr. Page," said
the nurse as she took his proffered hand, "here is
a young lady who needs a few words of resignation
and comfort dropped into her wounded heart,
and you have always such a rich store on hand
that I felt you would be willing to administer a
few to one who needs them so much."</p>

<p>"I shall be obliged to give them second hand
you know." How his pale face lighted as he said
this, and extending his hand to Anna invited her
to sit beside him. "It is hard to be afflicted," he
said, "but you know they sometimes provide a
very white robe for such as we." Then he spoke
so calmly and soothingly as he inquired into her
griefs, while he poured oil of peace into her lacerated
heart until the pain ceased and she was
soothed and comforted. "What was your brother's
name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Herbert Pierson."</p>

<p>"Herbert Pierson? You should not grieve for
him! He had a noble soul. I knew him well,
and when the surgeon told me yesterday that he
was dead I thanked God for his release from
suffering. Could he speak to you to-day he would
say as I have, 'do not grieve for me!' How often
I have heard him speak of his sister and mother,
and pray for them too. Ah&mdash;there is comfort for
you beyond my poor powers of giving! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
blessed sufferer who atoned for you and me will
bestow it! Your brother was mine in heart; how
I loved him!"</p>

<p>"O thank you; thank you!" sobbed Anna as
she clasped his thin hand in hers! "His mother
will bless and pray for you," she continued.</p>

<p>"And will not you?"</p>

<p>"I? I do not pray for myself! I wish to die."</p>

<p>"Then you will! God be praised!"</p>

<p>"I will see you again," she said rising, and
catching one more glance of his calm, blue eyes
she hurried away. After tea she retired to her
room, much against the wishes of Mrs. Howard,
who was urgent in her requests that Anna should
visit her patient that night, but all to no avail.
"Tell him," she said, "I will see him in the morning;
I <i>can not</i> go to-night; O no, I can not!" and
entering her seclusion she closed the door, much to
the chagrin of the good lady, and seated herself to
collect her thoughts.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3><a name="THE_RECOGNITION" id="THE_RECOGNITION"></a>THE RECOGNITION.</h3>


<p>Anna awoke the next morning with the half-dreamy
consciousness of some impending evil or
gloomy foreboding or trial she was expected to
meet or avert. For a long time she lay on her
bed balanced between a peaceful unconsciousness
and the stern realities of duty that were rising
before her, until at last the full burden of life
rolled in upon her mind. Springing from her bed
she dropped upon her knees beside it. For the
first time in her life she discovered her utter helplessness;
her inability to go alone! Before her
were heavy loads she was expected to take up and
carry along, but with this consciousness came
also the invitations whispered to her shrinking
heart, "come unto me"&mdash;"cast thy burden on the
Lord and He will sustain thee." There in the
solitude of that early morn she came close to Him
who had promised strength sufficient in every time
of trouble and perplexity. Firmer were her purposes
when she arose from her knees; more willing
was she to sacrifice all her dearest hopes at the
feet of justice, if such stern duty was in store for
her. As tears are sometimes the gentle dew that
falls upon and refreshes the drooping flowers of
life, so prayer is the concentration of the golden
rays of light that color and beautify the re-animated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
petals, sending into the heart once filled with
desolation and despair the freshness of a new life,
and driving out the dying fumes that arise from
the withered flowers where fond hopes lie buried.
Softly came this gentle influence into the soul of
her who under the shadows was kneeling and
praying! Was it faith or love that was soothing
her? Perhaps neither. The burdened spirit may
not yet have drunk from the golden cup which
the hand of mercy had proffered; but it had listened
to the music of pity's hovering wings as she
brooded near while gathering up the fragrance of
the heart's petitions to bear away with the tears
from the overflowing soul. Anna felt these refreshing
influences, yet she knew not from whence
they came. Her face bore the softening impress
as she entered the breakfast room and inquired
regarding the wounded colonel.</p>

<p>"He is a little more quiet this morning," replied
Mrs. Howard; "but was very restless all
night. I was up with him the greater part of the
time." Anna seated herself at the table but could
not eat.</p>

<p>"I think I will go over to the hospital for a few
minutes," she said, rising; "tell him I will soon
return and then will come to him."</p>

<p>"Why not go now, Miss Pierson? It is sad to
witness his misery! Your absence, I am sure, is
now his greatest affliction!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I must go and get my own wounds
dressed before I can attend to others!" This last
remark was made partly to herself as she left the
room, but enough fell on the ear of the listener to
fill her with astonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"What could the girl mean?" she asked herself
over and over again, but received no satisfactory
reply. In the meantime Anna was making her
way to the hospital, and upon arriving proceeded
immediately to the ward where she had, on the
day before, talked with the one who had known
and loved her brother. But he was not there.
Even the cot had been removed, and on the floor
where it had stood a large dark spot was seen.
Sick at heart and without one word of inquiry she
hurried into the next room where the kind old
nurse could, she was sure, tell her all.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, these things are dreadful for us to
bear," was the reply to her visitor's earnest questionings;
"but could you have seen his face as his
life rapidly ebbed away you would have been satisfied
that sometimes 'it is Christ to live, but to die
is gain.' What you saw yesterday was no comparison
to it; so holy; so joyous! It was about
four this morning they called me, but so rapid was
his going that I only caught a glimpse of the
glory that shone through as the gate to the 'city'
opened for him!"</p>

<p>"Yet it seems so hard to me just now that he
must die," interposed Anna as she looked dreamily
out over the long rows of cots where wounded
men were lying. "Was it because my poor heart
reached out after him in its sorest need? Must all
be taken?" She had said this musingly, but the
nurse heard it and her face shone with interest.
"Forgive me," she added quickly, perceiving the
look that was fastened upon her, "I was bewildered
for a moment."</p>

<p>"There is a Comforter, and it was He that gave
him his powers of consolation! You know he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
yesterday that he would be obliged to bestow only
second hand what he had received."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember, but tell me more of him."</p>

<p>"It is the story of many others, yet it came all
unexpectedly, as it has often done. It was the
giving way of the main artery that had been
severed so near the body that there was no chance
for again securing it. It was not five minutes
after he discovered his position before he was
quietly sleeping! Such a death has no sadness
in it my dear girl, for it was only stepping out of
pain and suffering into peace and rejoicing!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Anna as she turned away,
for kind words were needed elsewhere. Alone in
her room again she gave full vent to her feelings.
"I am ready now," she thought as she bathed her
face that her swollen lids might not grieve him,
and prepared to fulfill her promise. It was with
trembling steps, however, that she entered the
room where George St. Clair was lying. He was
alone and apparently asleep as she approached the
bedside and looked down into his face so calm in
its repose; so gentle in its outline; almost feminine
it appeared to her in its tenderness. Yet she
had seen it when it was not as it was now. How
different! She placed her hand on his forehead
that he might awake before the dark thoughts
should come back to her. He opened his eyes and
looked full into hers! A deep flush overspread
his face, yet not a muscle moved or a word escaped
his lips. "George, will you not speak to me?"
she asked at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, Anna; but why have you absented yourself
so long? Have you desired to revenge your
brother's blood upon me? Upon my poor head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Anna? Are you so cruel? Tell me that you lay
not that sin at my door; or use the dagger for my
more immediate relief! Does this shock you?
Am I the one who is the most cruel after all?"</p>

<p>Anna sank down upon a chair near by and
buried her face in the pillow. Both were silent
for a long time; at length Mrs. Howard entering
aroused her.</p>

<p>"You must not disturb my patient, you know,"
she said with an attempt at pleasantry, for she
was happy to see Anna at last where she thought
she ought to be. "You are to cheer him up, for
he seems quite low spirited to-day."</p>

<p>"We shall, no doubt, do very well," replied St.
Clair, impatiently; and the kind-hearted lady after
administering the medicine, left the room.</p>

<p>"Anna, will you move your chair a little this
way that I may see your face? I want to talk
candidly with you." She obeyed. He looked at
her for a moment, but there was more of sorrow
than scrutiny in his gaze. At last he said, "Mrs.
Howard tells me you are going home."</p>

<p>"Yes, I must go; my mother will want all that
is left of him whom she has so dearly loved! The
staff is broken upon which she expected to lean in
her declining years. It is a hard task, but I have
no power to shrink from it!"</p>

<p>"Have you made all of your calculations to do
so?"</p>

<p>"Not wholly. I shall wait for your father whom
I am expecting here to-morrow in company with
Ellen."</p>

<p>"Ellen? Is she coming? Then you will not
return?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" This was spoken with a tremulous voice,
and she knew his eyes were fixed intently upon
her. "You will not need me," she continued,
after a moment's pause; "your sister Ellen can
do all it would have been in my power to perform,
and my mother will be very lonely and sad without
me."</p>

<p>"You did not think Ellen was so efficient a few
days ago, Anna. How changed you are! Yes,
I think I understand you; but can you not be
mistaken? Look at my hands, dear girl, are
there any dark stains upon them? Think of my
prostrate form; is he the less guilty who spilled
my blood because this life did not escape through
the wound? Blood for blood, Anna, and justice is
satisfied! Are you sterner than that insatiate
power?"</p>

<p>Tears flooded her eyes and she bowed her head
to conceal them. Where now was the strength
she had expected would sustain her through this
trying ordeal? O how weak she seemed! How
flitting the sunshine that had but a short time before
gilded her darkness!</p>

<p>"Anna," said her companion, "your heart is
pleading for me! It is not your better judgment
that is sitting at my tribunal at this moment; I
know it all! I read it months ago as you stood
before me so cold and stern when you first beheld
my uniform, and it has followed you ever since.
You loved me then and you cannot hate me now!
Look up, Anna, and tell me if my words are not
true?" She obeyed.</p>

<p>"They are true! I did love you, and God knows
how hard it would be to tear that love from my
heart! But you will wait; the storm has burst in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
upon my soul. When the fury is past and the
clouds are broken, in the calm you shall read
what now is so bleared and illegible! George,
you can never know the depths of sadness that is
permeating my every hope and aspiration! If
you knew the agony of the last few hours, that
has torn me like an evil spirit, you would pity
me!"</p>

<p>"I do pity you, Anna; and will trouble you no
longer lest my words should prove an infliction
rather than a panacea, and I will, as you have requested,
bide patiently your time." The young
lady arose and stood before him.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, George, make haste to recover,"
she said without emotion; "your mother pines for
you and many hearts will rejoice when you are
well again." He was looking steadily at her
while she spoke, and their eyes met. Her lips
quivered, but quickly bowing her head she pressed
a kiss upon his brow and darted from the room.</p>

<p>Early the next morning after a restless, sleepless
night, Anna prepared herself for another visit
to the young lady who had so tenderly nursed
her brother during his days of suffering and death.
She did so long to look again into those deep,
dark eyes, from which had beamed so much sympathy,
and to ask many questions which she had
omitted at their former interviews. It was a damp,
chill morning, for the sun was hiding behind dense
leaden clouds and a thick fog had settled down
upon the city. However, she liked all this, for
nature was in her most congenial mood with such
frowns upon her face, and so she hurried on. She
received a warm greeting from the beautiful nurse,
whom she noticed was much paler than when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
saw her last, and was at the moment apparently
unusually agitated. Not far from her two ladies
richly, but plainly attired, were standing conversing
in low, soothing tones with a sick soldier.</p>

<p>"Do you know those ladies?" she asked eagerly
as she clasped the hand of her visitor.</p>

<p>"No, although I have caught a glimpse of their
dresses several times in the other wards during
the last few days," replied Anna, stepping back a
little that she might look into their faces. But in
vain. "I have heard one of them spoken of as a
very wealthy English lady who was at the south,
but was compelled to come north on account of
her anti-war principles; but have thought very
little about them."</p>

<p>"I must see that face again!" said the nurse,
musingly. "See how persistently they keep their
backs toward me! They have been here an hour
and seem in no hurry to go, yet it is impossible
for me to catch the eye again of that one wearing
the gray silk. I have seen her before, Miss Pierson;
I am sure of it!" A call from one of the
patients interrupted the conversation. Anna
moved slowly down the apartment to intercept, and
if possible to engage them in conversation, while
her friend could have the privilege she so ardently
coveted. She was avoided, however, and the visitors
soon passed out into the open air.</p>

<p>"Do tell me what it was that came over you so
suddenly with sufficient power to shake your dry
bones so effectually, and take all of the brass out
of your face?" inquired one of the worthies when
once again clear of searching eyes.</p>

<p>"Do not jest!" entreated her companion. "Matters
are becoming rather serious to me, as you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
acknowledge when I tell you that the young nurse
in whom you seemed so much interested is my
own daughter!"</p>

<p>"Your daughter! I do not wonder that you
shook in your boots! Do you suppose that she
recognized you?"</p>

<p>"I feel sure of it, for her cheek paled as she
caught the glance of my eye, and I felt all the
time we were there that she was watching me!"</p>

<p>"How do you suppose she came here? You
told me she was with an aunt in New Orleans!"</p>

<p>"So she was, the idiot!" was the answering exclamation.
"I have no patience with her! She
has been my tormentor for years! It was not
enough for her to throw away all of my cherished
plans, depriving me of home and fortune, but now
she must appear to add the crowning act to my
discomfiture!"</p>

<p>"Would you have me believe all this of one
who is so mild and gentle, with eyes as calm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not mention those eyes! They were her
father's, and she is like him! Yet he was good!
I do not think I should be where I am to-day if
he had lived! I have been tumbling for years&mdash;yes,
years! And what a depth I have fallen!"
The speaker endeavored to smile, but the attempt
died upon her pallid lips. "Let us hasten back
to the city," she continued, seeing her companion
showed no desire to speak: "I must have time to
think!"</p>

<p>They walked on a short distance without
another word, and then her companion said,
abruptly: "You have not told me why, in your
opinion, she is here? Was she always remarkable
for tenderness and benevolence? It seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
me that the mother-power was deficient in regard
to the little matter of early teaching in the science
of patriotism!"</p>

<p>"Your tones are annoying, but I will satisfy
your plausible curiosity in a measure! It was
not 'tenderness or benevolence' that has drawn
her thither, but, in my opinion, an old love affair
gotten up while in Philadelphia at school when
yet a child. She was supposed to be an heiress,
of course, and was wheedled into accepting the
proffers of undying adoration from a scheming
fortune-hunter! It did not take me long to end
the affair after I learned of it, I can tell you; but
it spoiled her! It was then that she laid the
corner stone of the sepulcher which she has been
rearing over me, and now, I suppose, will deliberately
pull down about my ears!"</p>

<p>"The sea does look a little squally, I confess,"
replied her companion sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I own it does!"</p>

<p>"Well, as I am aboard of your ship it may be
well for me to be looking out for breakers ahead.
And yet I cannot understand how that 'love
affair' of which you have told me could affect her
now!"</p>

<p>"Well, I do! Without doubt she hopes to find
him; but it does not matter what are her ambitions
she is here much against my wishes and happiness!"</p>

<p>Happiness! Ah, where can the transgressor
find peace or rest? "Who is wise shall understand
these things; prudent and he shall know
them, for the ways of the Lord are right and the
just shall walk in them, but the transgressors
shall fall therein."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Anna might have joined in the confusion and
agitation of her friend had she caught a look as
she desired from the keen, black eyes which had
so troubled her in former days. But, strange as it
may seem, those penetrating orbs failed to recognize
in her whom they tried to avoid the sweet
singer of "Cathesdra." The "nobody" whom her
cousin persisted in raising out of her sphere had
dropped from her mind. Neither had Anna ever
met the daughter of Mrs. Belmont during her stay
in the home of the St. Clair's, and could not, therefore,
suspect that the meek, gentle nurse who had
so won her heart was the one of whom she had so
often heard. She had been told by Ellen of her
brother's attachment and of their final separation,
and he, only two mornings since, had substantiated
her statement with the assurance that his imaginary
love had been proved to himself to be only a
fostered brotherly affection for his pretty cousin.
They looked into each other's faces and smiled at
the parting, little thinking how much of mystery
was concealed from view.</p>

<p>"If one could only be seen in the light that
falls upon them from the eternal brightness what
a transfiguration it would work! There are estrangements
and alienations," says some one,
"that arise from ignorance of one another that divide
families into almost as distinct and separate
lives as rooms in the house they occupy."</p>

<p>"Hands to work and hearts to God," once said
Emerson, while Tennyson adds: "In this windy
world what's up is faith, what's down is heresy!"
Anna was nervous and restless as she thought
over these things, and all of the next night lay
tossing upon her bed, vainly endeavoring to woo
the gentle slumbers that would not come to her.
It seemed so sad now that it was all over, and it
<i>was</i> strange that George St. Clair should have
dismissed her so coldly! It was not her fault that
she could not dispel this "phantom" as he called
it; yet he <i>pitied</i> her! Was this the panacea he
strove so hard to apply to her wounded soul?
True, she asked him for it, yet pride rebelled at
its application! Pity! The long, weary hours
were filled with exciting whispers, and ever and
anon the chilling words, "I will trouble you no
longer," fell like hard, cold pebbles into her sensitive
soul. At last summoning all her fortitude
she congratulated herself that on the morrow Mrs.
St. Clair and Ellen would arrive. Then she could
return home, where silently and alone she would
dig a grave in some lonely recess of her stricken
heart and bury her two great sorrows side by side!
To-morrow! The clock struck five and the sound
of feet were heard below. The night had passed!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
She arose from her bed and opened the window.
One star yet faintly glimmered just above the
eastern horizon, up which the first morning beams
were slowly creeping. Calmly and peacefully it
looked into the troubled upturned face so full of
sorrow and flushed with weeping, until Anna
thought that in its pensive gaze there was such
pity as the angels might bestow upon their weary
earth-born sisters. Then her thoughts wandered
away to those who would be weary no more;
whose foot-prints would never more be seen along
the dusty highway of life, for they were resting
now, their journeys over, their spirits freed from
their crumbling prison-houses! At rest! The
pale tranquil light of the lonely star grew paler
and more feeble as she continued to gaze upon it,
for a new day was approaching, and in the glory
of its brightness the tiny light was to be swallowed
up. Fading, changing, everywhere! How sad a
lesson is life! How rugged and thorny the way
through it! "To look up is faith," repeated Anna
again; "Thou wilt show me the path of life; in Thy
presence is fullness of joy; at Thy right hand
there are pleasures forevermore! Hush!" It
was not her own voice to which she was listening,
but the echoing of her poor pleading heart which
had suddenly remembered that to look down where
all the dreary shadows were clustered was "heresy."
The day was before her heavily laden with duties.
Why should she grope under the clouds where
were doubts and unbeliefs? By and by it may be
she too would rest! A step along the hall startled
her. It was that of the black servant leaving his
master's room. "How faithful he has been," she
thought, "while I have only brought discomforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
where I had so desired to bring relief." It was over
now; her dream of hope, of love, of life! All was
over; yet her hand still clasped the "golden
bowl," and the "silver cord" was not broken!
There was sweet water still in the fountain, although
at times it might seem bitter to the taste.</p>

<p>She was standing by the mirror arranging the
braids of her dark hair as these reflections were
passing through her mind. "How changed I am,"
she continued, "not only in mind but in face!
Perplexities and disappointments are making sad
havoc with my good looks! I must away from
this," and after preparing herself for a walk she
hastened to the hospital. She filled the moments
of the laggard morning full of untiring work by
the side of the young nurse who flitted among the
cots where anxious, loving eyes watched for her
coming and grew dim as she disappeared from
their sight. Still her thoughts were roving and
regrets came to disturb her as she remembered
that no more could she place the cup of cold water
to fevered lips, or with her words soothe troubled
minds. She was going home to bury her dead,
while so many were to remain to be buried by
stranger hands! The voice of the nurse recalled
her.</p>

<p>"There was a big skirmish down the river last
night and some of our officers were disabled and
are to be brought here to-day, we are informed by
telegram!" and she walked on where an upraised
hand was beckoning.</p>

<p>"Who knows but my poor brother is one of the
fallen?" Anna mused as she proceeded towards
her temporary home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>It was nearly dinner-time and she must not let
the whole day pass without visiting the lonely one
under her own roof. True, he had not invited her
to come again at the close of their last interview,
but he had hinted a wish that she should read the
morning papers to him on her return, Mrs. Howard
had said. She had hoped to escape this, but she
was calmer now. Herbert was gone; men might
be falling on the battle field any day! It was the
hand of war, not of individuals, that was slaying
the mothers' and sisters' loved ones all over the
land! Poor heart! The tidal wave was receding,
but the waters underneath were black and unfathomable!</p>

<p>"He is better, I think," Mrs. Howard went on
to say, "and in a few days, no doubt, will be able
to sit up in an easy chair part of the time. He
asked a while ago if you had returned from the
hospital, and looked, as he always does, a little out
of patience that you should devote so much of
your time to others."</p>

<p>Anna was not listening as her hostess bustled
about the table prattling in an unusual manner, as
it was evident that she was probing with her feminine
curiosity deeper than had been her wont, and
it seemed the duty of her victim to push the intruding
hand away.</p>

<p>"But you will go to him?" was the abrupt
query at last.</p>

<p>"It is my intention," and Anna passed into the
hall. The door of the sick man's chamber was
open, and before she had reached the upper landing
she heard her name called.</p>

<p>"I want to see you Anna. Please bring the
morning papers, will you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>She could not resist the pleading of the voice,
and, besides, she had expected to see him again;
but how could she read to him.</p>

<p>"I was intending to brush away a little of the
dust of morning labor before coming to you," she
remarked with a smile as she entered and took a
seat beside the bed.</p>

<p>"Do a better thing, Anna, and brush away the
dust from my hopes and out of my life! Would
not that be a more merciful act?"</p>

<p>"Can I do all that, George?" and she laid her
hand soothingly upon his white forehead.</p>

<p>"You ought to be able to do so, since it was
your hands scattered it."</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>"Is it your purpose to go home and leave me
here with your bloody spectre to haunt and distract
me? Do I deserve such punishment?
Should loyalty to my native land be crowned with
such terrible thorns? You have confessed, Anna,
that a few months ago you loved me, is that most
holy attribute so easily uprooted? If so, then I
have been mistaken in woman's heart?" He was
looking in her face, that was thinner and, it may
be, paler than he had ever seen it, and his manly
nature came to the rescue. "Forgive me, Anna,
I will not be so cruel! There is somewhere a
God who will make all right in His own good time,
as Old Auntie would say; and last night as Toby
lay snoring on the lounge yonder, I thought it all
over. Yes, there is a God; and it may be He is at
work in this great war problem, and when the final
result is summed up, we shall be glad that the
storm passed this way, because of the happy
issues. Who knows? But, dear girl, assure me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of my guiltlessness in creating the blast, or the
terrible lightning that is desolating so many hearts
and homes! Will you?"</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to his face, and a smile
broke over her own. "How low are the mighty
fallen!" and a low, rippling laugh mingled itself
with her words. "Did you ever imagine that I
thought you such a great man, so strong and
powerful?"</p>

<p>"My own Anna!" he exclaimed, taking her
hand passionately in his. "You are not going to
leave me comfortless, but will wipe away the mold
from hopes, and thus brighten up the future by
letting the sunshine in upon them again." He
drew the beaming face down to his own and their
lips sealed the contract of mutual love and forgiveness.</p>

<p>"I did not mean to grieve you," she said at last,
"but the blow was a heavy one, and all things
seemed to combine their powers to keep my 'phantom'
in active existence, but they are gone now."</p>

<p>"Tell me that no more shall this murderous
spectre stand between us. This terrible war may
have crippled me for life; my home and fortune
be taken from me through its ravages; but if you
love and trust me, I shall, notwithstanding all, be
the happiest of men."</p>

<p>"Is the wound then, so very bad."</p>

<p>"The surgeon has more than hinted that my
days of soldiering are over, but was that all you
heard of my long speech, made especially for your
ear?" he laughed. "You would not care to unite
your destinies with a cripple, and how would it be
if the fortune was also gone? O, Anna!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not, George. I had not thought of all that,
my mind is not capable of taking such fanciful
leaps; I was only thinking how sad all this would
be for one like you. But I could not be sorry if
assured that you would fight no more."</p>

<p>"Even though a broken back was my preventive?"</p>

<p>"The glimpses that come to us at this moment
from the overshadowed future are too bright to be
flecked with such dark presentiments; I cannot
believe them. But there is Mrs. Howard's steps,
on the stairs. How kind she has been, and what
a miserable nurse I have proven myself."</p>

<p>"Oh pshaw! I have improved more during
the last half hour, under your fostering care, than
I should have done in three weeks of her nursing.
But you must not go yet or there will be great
danger of a serious relapse! I will send the good
soul to Jericho as soon as I have swallowed her potion,
for I have much I want to say while the opportunity
is ours."</p>

<p>"I think it will be necessary for you to begin
again on these fever drops, as I see your cheeks are
quite red this afternoon," carelessly remarked the
good lady, as she placed the spoon to his lips.
There was a roguish twinkle in her eye, however,
which Anna did not fail to perceive.</p>

<p>"Hang the fever drops!" exclaimed the patient;
"I am ever so much better, and am pondering the
propriety of going home with Miss Pierson to-morrow."</p>

<p>The kind lady shook with suppressed mirth as
she went from the room, for her keen eyes had
looked deeper than ever before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening Ellen and her father arrived. It
had been a weary morning to Anna, for she had
waited their coming with an anxious heart, but the
sky was clear now and she returned their greetings
with fervor, wearing her great grief, it was true,
but the joys of the previous hours had so covered
it that the dear ones were astonished to find
her bright beneath the shadow of sorrow.</p>

<p>"My poor son," exclaimed Mr. St. Clair, as
the first greetings were over. "Yes, Anna; show
us the way to him." She obeyed, and as they
were ascending the stairs, the father remarked, "I
have no doubt we shall receive a favorable report
of your nursing, for I am convinced by the pallor
of your cheeks that there have been sad hours of
watching and anxiety."</p>

<p>"How I shrink from taking your place," interrupted
the sister. "Poor George! He will readily
perceive the difference, I fear."</p>

<p>Anna's heart sank within her as she listened to
the words of her companions, who were all unconscious
of the wounds they were probing. Ellen
must not know it; and then she was so soon to
leave him! This would be harder now, but he
was to fight no more and they might yet be happy!
It was a grief to her that she had ever neglected
him and brought sorrow instead of joy into his
hours of suffering. She opened the door of the sick
man's chamber, and as the father and sister passed
in reclosed it and retired to her own room. More
than one reason prompted her to do this, yet they
must know in time that a great joy had been amid
her throes of bereavement. She would not have
them grieved by her seeming idiosyncrasies. They
might blame her for apparent neglect; and O if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
had not been! Still he had not suffered as had
she; her heart assured her of this, and it pressed
the thought as a consolation over the bleeding
fissure as the wounded bird attempts to hide its
ebbing life's blood beneath its fluttering wing!
But it was over, and now the phantom had been
driven, ah whither? Would it ever haunt her
again? He had said: "There is a God somewhere
who will make it all right in His own good time,"
and she would wait.</p>

<p>Tea was ready and the three sat down together,
Mr. St. Clair and Ellen to satisfy a sharpened appetite
after a long and tiresome journey, and Anna
to do the honors of the table after their home style
in the north.</p>

<p>"George is looking so much better than I had
hoped to find him," said the father. "I think I
shall be obliged to bless you Miss Anna for his
rapid improvement. It has been so kind in you
to think of others, although you were so heavily
burdened with your own bitter sorrow! What a
debt of gratitude you and yours are heaping upon
us!" he continued, musingly. "But war must
always bear its 'apples of ashes' and God only
knows where the ax should be laid!"</p>

<p>There were tears in Anna's eyes, for the fountain
of grief had been for so many days open that
the liquid drops flowed now almost unconsciously
when the angel of pity stirred the bitter waters.
Ellen saw them and the dew-drops of sympathy
moistened her own dark ones. "It would be so
hard to lose a brother," she thought. "How glad
she was that George was better!"</p>

<p>"You must go with us," said Ellen as they
arose from the table and went out into the hall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
"You must begin to initiate me in your skill of
hygiene; beside, George inquired for you. I see
how it will be, you are to be sadly missed when
only my poor inexperienced hands are brought
into service!" She noticed the agitation of her
companion, and placing an arm affectionately
around her said, soothingly: "You know my
heart, dear girl, and that it is full of sympathy,
but my tongue is a miserable medium with which
to communicate it to another! Let it be sufficient
that I can feel that you are sure of this and will
never doubt me!"</p>

<p>"Doubt you, Ellen? Never for a moment!
But my mother; how is she?"</p>

<p>"Sorrow-stricken, of course, but strangely resigned.
There is something noble in such a grief
as hers, Anna! No, you need not shrink from
meeting her; she will comfort you! I see by your
face, poor sufferer, that you need it! She will do
you good, never fear!"</p>

<p>"Just step in my room for a moment, Ellen; I
would not have him see me tear-stained again. I
have wept so much for the last few days. You
speak truly, I do need my mother, for I am very
weak. Ellen, there has been more gall in the cup
I have been draining than you can ever know! A
darker wave has rolled over my soul than can ever
lift your bark, my precious friend; but what matters
it after all, when we find ourselves sinking we
are led to cry out 'save or I perish?' We shall be
chided some day for our faithlessness and doubtings,
and it is better that we should receive it
while yet on the sea, for the calm, Ellen, is peaceful
after the storm." She had been bathing her
face and arranging her hair while speaking, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
now turned toward her companion with the old
smile wreathing her lips.</p>

<p>"You are like your mother," and again the arm
of affection drew them closer together as they proceeded
to the room where the father and brother
were awaiting them.</p>

<p>That night, contrary to the doctor's instructions,
there was a long conversation in the sick man's
chamber, in which he earnestly joined.</p>

<p>"Let it be settled, Father, that you return with
Anna," he said at length. "I shall get along all
right with Ellen and Mrs. Howard, with what
Toby can help, I have not the least doubt; and,
besides, we rebels must not be too exacting or expect
too much." His eyes were upon Anna, and
she knew it. Her cheeks flushed, but the great
hope in her heart kept back the haunting spectre
his words might otherwise have summoned.</p>

<p>"He is a rebel no more," she thought. His
voice recalled her.</p>

<p>"Besides, you will be needed in the widow's
home to assist and cheer. It will not be a great
while before I shall be able to join you all there,
for immediately on being well enough to sit up for
a few hours I shall leave for the North&mdash;through
my convalescence at least."</p>

<p>There were quick glances into each other's faces,
but he was silent.</p>

<p>"I will do as you say, my son," was the father's
conclusion, "but I fear we are tiring you.
Yes, you will feel better after a rest, and to-morrow
we will talk farther on the subject."</p>

<p>Four days afterward a solemn cortege wended
its way through the little village of Glendale, bearing
its dead from the station to the home of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
bereavement and sorrow. There were warm hand
claspings, and words of sympathy and condolence,
and tears, such as mothers alone can shed, when
maternal love is stricken; when heart answers to
heart with the sad echo of loneliness and desolation.</p>

<p>And so they laid Edward Pierson away upon the
hillside; the first martyr in all the region on the
altar of freedom!</p>

<h3><a name="NEW_RESOLVES_AND_NEW_ADVENTURES" id="NEW_RESOLVES_AND_NEW_ADVENTURES"></a>NEW RESOLVES&mdash;AND NEW ADVENTURES.</h3>


<p>"Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a
plain path, because of mine enemies. Deliver me
not over unto the will of mine enemies, for false
witnesses are risen up against me, and such as
breathe out cruelty."</p>

<p>These words Lillian Belmont repeated to herself
as the carriage that was bearing her away
from home and early associations rolled down the
highway leading to the depot, where she with her
cousin Grace Stanley were to take the cars for
New Orleans. Mrs. Stanley was the youngest
sister of the deceased master of Rosedale, but
since his death very little intimacy had been continued
between the families, until Mrs. Belmont
meeting the vivacious, merry-hearted Grace had
conceived the idea of using her for a purpose, and
so had invited her to spend a few weeks with her
"morbid" cousin. All things, however, had not
worked to that lady's satisfaction, as we have
learned, and now with a mother's curse weighing
her down the daughter had joined with David in
the supplication, "lead me in a plain path." Was
He leading her? The path as yet was dark and
overshadowed, but she had clasped the gentle hand
and the promise was, "I will never leave or forsake
thee;" and with simple, childlike trust she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
walked forward. During the winter she had written
several times to her mother, pleading she
would clear away the mysteries of the past, remove
the maternal edicts, so that over the debris of
broken hopes and shattered ambitions they might
again come together, reconciled and loving. But
no response to these pleadings came to her. To
be sure there were letters from loved ones telling
of the early removal of her family to the city, of
the visit to the Washburn's, of the sudden death of
little Shady, with poor old Vina's wail of anguish,
but not a word of sympathy from the heart where
the maternal love lay buried.</p>

<p>The bugle notes of war sounded through the
streets of New Orleans, and the passions of men
were stirred as never before. Women too, who had
quaffed only from the chalice of ease and pleasure,
awoke from the lethargy of indulgence to find
themselves tossing upon a sea of excitement and
alarm. Lillian was interested, and for a time her
own troubled life was swallowed up in the tumults
that threatened the peace and harmony of the
nation's life. Bustle, energy and activity were
everywhere.</p>

<p>"What a useless, helpless thing I am!" she
said to her aunt one evening as they sat alone,
after the husband, who was wearied with his day's
toils in the unpretentious hardware store near the
wharf had retired to his room, and Grace was entertaining
a friend in the parlor. "It seems to me
I am suddenly aroused by a storm, and unless I
run for my life shall be covered out of sight in its
fury!" She laughed, but there was a seriousness
in her pale face her aunt had never seen upon it
before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not wonder you think yourself out in the
wind," was the cheerful response, "for Grace is
enough to stir up the sleepy faculties of any lover
of her country. I do not know but she will
'shoulder arms' and go into the field in defence
of her native land!" and the good lady laughed
outright. There was a long silence, while Lillian
never once removed her gaze from the dying
embers in the grate as she actively traced the
wanderings and leapings of her busy thoughts.</p>

<p>At last she said in an undertone: "Grace is very
gentle considering her confederate proclivities; but
has it occurred to you that I have a <i>husband</i>
somewhere in that confusion and excitement
among our enemies, as we call them?"</p>

<p>"O, Lillian!" and the cheerful face put on a
look of serious incredulity. "You will not now
certainly desire to seek out a relationship from
among a people, who would, if in their power, kill
or enslave us all?" Lillian's dark eyes wandered
slowly to the troubled face of the speaker. "I
have fully joined with my daughter in the feeling
that a great wrong has been perpetrated on you,
still I did hope that this terrible war would obliterate
forever all such former ties and leave you
free, as free as though they had never been!"</p>

<p>"And here I am shocking you with my heart's
cry for its idol, for its tenderest loves, for the
purest longings known to woman's nature! Listen
to me, Aunt Sylvia, I am going north! The
blow has been struck! Fort Sumter has fallen!
There will be wounded hearts to bind up and
wounded bodies to care for! Sorrow and lamentation
will fill many homes, and the cry for help and
sympathy will sound over the land. I shall get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
out of my life of indolence and plunge into the
thickest scenes of labor!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lillian, you do shock me! Why go
north? If you must work, will there not be plenty
of it to do among your own people? Are they not
as deserving of your care and sympathy as their
enemies?"</p>

<p>"Auntie, I have told Grace and now will tell
you! Somewhere in the north I have a husband
and child! Do not look at me with that spirit of
incredulity peering out of your eyes, for it is no
random suspicion&mdash;no new thought. My husband
lives, and the letter I received last night from
George St. Clair gives me the information that a
'Pearl Hamilton,' who started with a captain's
commission from Pennsylvania was promoted to
the position of colonel of his regiment by the entire
vote of each company upon reaching Washington.
This he copied from a paper for my especial
benefit; and that Colonel Hamilton is <i>my husband</i>;
<i>my Pearl!</i> He is true to me&mdash;our hearts are one,
and the fast growing desire to go to him has,
since the receipt of that letter, become full-fledged;
and before communication between the two sections
is entirely cut off I shall go!"</p>

<p>"Did not the knowledge of his notoriety help to
feather the wings of love, my child?"</p>

<p>There was something in the tone of voice with
which these words were uttered that caused the
listener's face to flush with amazement and indignation.</p>

<p>"This from you, Auntie!" she said at last.
"Look at me; remember what I have endured,
realize for a moment from what I have been torn,
consider the burdens that are weighing me down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and then, if it be possible, repeat the question.
You do not know me! For this reason I forgive
the cruel thrust! Pearl Hamilton would hold my
heart as firmly and truly if he were now the humble
clerk in the store where I first knew him, as
an honored officer in the enemy's army!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanley took the little white hand that lay
on the arm of the easy chair where Lillian was
sitting and holding it in her loving clasp, said,
soothingly: "My darling, I did not mean at all
what I said. You are too much like your father
to be guilty of such unwomanly selfishness. I
was a little indignant that you should persist in
keeping faith with your childhood's love, and so
uttered what I did not at all feel! I cannot, however,
endure the thought of your going through
the enemy's lines, and if he is a soldier as you
hear, he may be brought to you as a prisoner of
war, when you could be more speedily reunited
than if you should follow out your own wild
schemes."</p>

<p>"Pearl is not all I have in that muddle! Did I
not say a husband and child? Grace has told you
that I was a mother and that my pretty Lily died
and was buried; but my dear Aunt, I do not believe
it! I never did believe it! Still I had not
the power to combat the story that was told me!
O, I have been so weak! But a letter received by
my mother, and which accidentally fell into my
hands, and her confusion and evident alarm as I
held it before her, assured me that I was the subject
of a heartless fraud and that my child lived!
Ever since I have pondered how I could find her!
If I knew the place where she was born; at what
point on the Atlantic shore stood the romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
'Cliff House'; where I was imprisoned those dreadful
weeks, I should before this have visited it.
The weird old nurse would, I am sure, tell me all,
notwithstanding her bribes for secrecy!"</p>

<p>"Surely you do not believe all this, Lillian?
No wonder the hungering of your heart has eaten
the bloom from your cheek! But there must be
some mistake. No matter how lofty may be a
mother's ambition she could not be guilty of so
vile an act!"</p>

<p>"Auntie, my cry for months has been 'lead me
in a plain path', and I have been watching for the
shadows to clear away that I might see the road,
and now that my plea has been seemingly
answered and the 'path' winds alone through the
future mysteries so distinctly to my poor, trembling
vision shall I not walk therein? Indeed, I
<i>must</i> go! I can not sit idly here with folded
hands when there is so much to be done and so
many links to be gathered up! My mother well
understood my inertness and worthlessness; she
knew too that my pride would not long allow me
to be a dependent on those upon whom I only had
the claims of kinship. This, she was sure, would
in time bring me in humble penitence to her feet.
I cannot do this; and the other path leads me
farther away from her! I <i>must</i> go!"</p>

<p>True to her conclusions, in a few days Lillian
Belmont, the petted child of luxury, weak and
enervated by indolence and indulgence, started
alone amid the protestations and pleadings of
those who loved her, en route for Philadelphia
where she knew another aunt, the oldest sister of
her father, would give her a hearty welcome. It
was a tiresome and exciting journey. Quizzing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
eyes were upon her everywhere; suspicious glances
were thrust at her from every side, and not
until she crossed the southern lines did she settle
calmly down.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cheevers received her as one risen from
the dead. Clasping the slender form in her arms
she gazed long and steadfastly into the pale face
without speaking. "To think it is Lillian!" she
said at last. "O, if Pearl were only here! How he
has loved you my child." But tears, the first that
had moistened the beautiful eyes of the stricken
Lillian for many weeks, were now choking her utterance,
and she lay as a weary child on the tender,
sympathizing breast where her poor head was pillowed.
Mrs. Cheevers had known what the longings
of the mother love meant. Well did she
understand the hungerings of its unsatisfied greed,
and as she kissed over and over again the pure
white forehead she thanked God that her brother's
child could nestle so closely to her empty breast!</p>

<p>"You can never know how peaceful I feel!"
Lillian said an hour after as they sat at a well-filled
board, where she was satisfying a keener
appetite than she had felt for many day. "I could
fly for very joy, so light and buoyant are my
spirits! I have carried a burden so long that the
release seems almost oppressive!"</p>

<p>"Poor child!" murmured the aunt, while the
masculine face opposite wore an expression of the
deepest sympathy.</p>

<p>"And to think," he said at last, "that we should
have believed for a moment what those letters contained!
You will, however, do me the honor,
wife, to assure our little Lillian that I never did!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will do you the justice to acknowledge that
if it had not been for Pearl Hamilton your guilt
would never have been a whit less than my own."
A merry laugh followed this remark, and when it
died away Lillian asked with as much calmness as
she could summon if she might be permitted to
examine the letters spoken of.</p>

<p>"Of course you may," interposed the uncle.
"Read them, every one, and then forgive your
fickle relative for swallowing the absurd idea that
she who could believe one of the noblest of men
was heartless! But he will be around after the
first three months are over, and then we shall see
how this matter is to be settled! In the meantime
you just rest here and grow fat, for we shall have
regular news from the battle field, and he is no
private! His mother is the proudest woman in
this immense city to-night; and I am going to tell
her that the dead is alive, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please do not Uncle!" pleaded Lillian. "Permit
me to remain secluded and unknown until&mdash;well,
for the present at least. It would be so awkward
to explain, and so impossible to convince.
Besides, I am in my swaddling clothes yet; let me
get a little stronger and firmer. I am so happy
that I fear any intrusion; and shall be jealous of
every interference."</p>

<p>"Say no more; I am not a woman, and can
govern the 'unruly member' with true masculine
power! Be happy, nothing shall interfere with
your growth or pleasure while you remain under
my roof;" and he took his hat from the rack and
stepped nimbly from the house.</p>

<p>Weeks passed. There had been a dead calm on
the Potomac which only served to agitate and stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
up a greater excitement elsewhere. There were
murmurings of discontent; whisperings ever so
faint of rebellion in high places; there were impetuous
longings and low mutterings of censure
because the wheels of progress were blocked and
the final consummation of overhanging difficulties
was not speedily brought about; not realizing
that God was marking out the path to a grand and
glorious victory. How prone are human eyes to
seek after their own paths and rely upon their own
strength to "overcome."</p>

<p>But the great battle, which sent terror into
thousands of hearts and homes, came at last!
Men gathered upon the street corners in the great
city, and quivering lips talked over the great defeat!
The hearts of women pressed silently the
bleeding wounds from which life-blood was ebbing,
for loved ones were slain; and the dark cloud
which had heretofore seemed no larger than a
man's hand was covering the whole sky. Where
was it all to end?</p>

<p>Lillian was mute but not inactive. Reports
heralded the startling facts that many officers were
wounded and many were killed. In the confusion
and excitement, names were withheld or not yet
ascertained, and three days cleared not away the
uncertainties.</p>

<p>"I shall go to Washington on the night train,"
said Lillian very calmly as the little circle were
talking it over at the table.</p>

<p>"You, my child? Pray what could you do in
such a place at a time like this?"</p>

<p>"Please do not think me entirely worthless Uncle;
I can do many things if sympathy compels
me, I feel sure. Why not I, as well as others?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Nurses are called for and if my hands have never
learned what belongs to them, my heart has become
familiar with the necessities sorrow demands.
I can speak soothing words to smooth the pillow of
the dying. I can give a cup of cold water if too
weak to bind up a broken limb! There is work
and I am going to offer myself to aid in performing
it. Do not oppose me. I have passed through
so many grades of opposition and contention that
I have become well skilled in the art of defeating,
so do not trouble yourself to combat me." She
smiled, but the new resolve had left its impress on
the calm, mild face, and no further opposition was
raised.</p>

<p>We have seen her in the hospital doing the work
of kindness and sympathy nobly and well. There
was not one whose gentle voice could woo the sufferer
into repose as could hers. Not one whose
nerves were firmer when duty laid her demand
upon them.</p>

<p>"There was a serious skirmish down the river
last night," she had said to Anna Pierson during
her last visit to the hospital, "and the wounded
were brought in." Colonel Hamilton, however,
did not arrive for two or three days, as his wounds
were aggravated, being the fracture of an arm and
the dislocation of the opposite shoulder, caused by
the falling from his horse. A bullet had also
lodged in his side at the time he was disabled, and
the uncertainties of his situation barred his removal.
The papers, however had not been silent,
and the young nurse had learned, before his coming,
of the fears entertained regarding him. How
she longed to administer to his every need, while
her heart shrank from the very thought of standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
before him. How would he meet her? He
was true, they had said; but could they read his
secret thought, or be sure of the emotions beneath
his calm exterior? He was noble and good, but
years would deck the saddest grave with blossoms,
and spread over it a rich covering of emerald
brightness.</p>

<p>She wondered and trembled, and prayed until
the day came when the stately form was carried
through the long ward and laid tenderly on a neat
white couch prepared for it. Then they came to
her.</p>

<p>"This new patient we will commit expressly to
your care;" said one. "He must soon be able to
mount his horse again, and no one can soothe an
impatient soldier back to life and activity as soon as
yourself, I am told, so do your best. Let me introduce
you," and the attendant turned toward the
bed where Colonel Hamilton was lying.</p>

<p>How her knees trembled, and what a faintness
came over her, yet she walked mechanically forward.
"Miss, Miss," and he turned towards Lillian
who was waiting for the introduction. "I
think you will get along rapidly with this young
lady to care for you;" and he bowed graciously.
The eyes of the wounded man were fixed intently
upon the pallid face before him, as the attendant
walked slowly away to conclude another matter in
the farther part of the ward. Neither spoke. Sixteen
years had, indeed, brought changes into the
face of each. He had grown handsomer and nobler,
she thought. Her face had become thinner and
paler, but those eyes; no, no one could mistake
their lustre or beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lillian?" he interrogated at last, with a doubtful
tone, "It must be, surely it must be Lillian!&mdash;my
own&mdash;my wife!"</p>

<p>She was beside him&mdash;her arms around his neck;</p>

<p>"Pearl! O, my husband! Thank God, you
are mine at last! You cannot leave me now, and
no one shall tear me from you."</p>

<p>Let us drop the veil; there are scenes too holy
for intruding eyes to dwell upon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3><a name="FLIGHT_OF_THE_SOUTHERN_SPY" id="FLIGHT_OF_THE_SOUTHERN_SPY"></a>FLIGHT OF THE SOUTHERN SPY.</h3>


<p>Swiftly the weeks sped onward, laden with the
events of the nation's disasters. Battles in the
far west were being fought, and mourning and
bereavements swept as a terrible wave over the
land, lighted up here and there with the exultations
of victory; but beneath all the waters lay
deep and turbid. Mrs. Southey remained secluded
for some days after her return from Alexandria.
She had no doubt but her daughter had recognized
her, notwithstanding her disguise, and in all probability
would endeavor to hunt her out. "Would
she expose me?" There was madness in the very
thought, but the question would often present
itself. "Yet what else could she do? Understanding,
as she does, my Confederate sentiments,
she cannot be at a loss in regard to my mission
here," was her daily conclusion, and strongly was
she tempted to fly from the city. But where could
she go? To Philadelphia? She had been criticised
severely from that source in regard to her
treatment of that very one from whom she was
now contemplating hiding herself. It would not be
pleasant going there, and no other northern home
was, to her knowledge, open to her.</p>

<p>After thinking it over, she calmly informed her
hostess that she proposed to remain where she was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
for the present at least, and trust the pride and
natural kindness of her daughter, who she must
confess had a goodly share of both these commodities.</p>

<p>"She would not willingly disgrace herself, nor,"
and she added with some hesitancy, "bring misery,
perhaps death, upon her mother: at least I must
rely upon all this as the lesser of the two evils."</p>

<p>"Then she is not wholly depraved, as you have
been so willing I should believe," remarked her
companion. "I thought I could not be mistaken
in that face. What if you should go and throw
yourself on her mercy? I can but feel sure that
you would receive it."</p>

<p>"No, I cannot do that. And then you thought
it impossible that she should recognize me. It
may be so. There certainly would be a want of
discretion should I wantonly expose myself without
a surety of protection. The only way I can
discover is to trust in Providence and wait results."</p>

<p>"Providence!" sneered her companion. "Meager
claims have we on its friendly protection I
imagine. The fact is, Mrs. Southey, we must figure
this whole matter for ourselves. There seems
to be considerable spunk in the plethoric old
gentleman this war is stirring up, and I doubt if
he would treat such as we with a great amount of
gallantry if introduced to him, and, therefore, let
us figure closely, and not trust to vagaries of which
we know so little. It may do for a <i>Christian like
yourself</i>, but you know that I am an outsider."
This last remark was a little too cynical, and the
lady to whom it was addressed arose to her feet
with flashing eyes. Her companion only smiled,
however, as she motioned her to be reseated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, <i>mon amie</i>, I did not really
think you would resent the first compliment I ever
gave you," she laughed, then continued. "I have
been hindering you all the time. Where were you
going? Out for a walk?"</p>

<p>No sisters ever understood each other better
than did these two women, and seldom was it that
two ever despised each other more. They had met
but seldom before "Mrs. Southey" came to
Washington as a southern spy, but well she knew
that in the home she sought she would find co-operation.
In this she had not been mistaken.
Her mission was carefully guarded, but her everyday
life underwent careful scrutiny. Her dignity
as the 'Mistress of Rosedale' was continually
pierced and wounded without mercy, while she remained
powerless in the hands of her tormentor.
The morning scene we are chronicling was not an
exceptional one; still it left the lady in a burning
rage. At dinner, however, the hostess met her
with many bland excuses for neglecting her so
long, thus pressing the thorns deeper that were
sorely goading her victim all unconsciously to
other eyes. How true that the spirit of evil despises
and seeks to lacerate itself when its reflection
is seen in the bosom of another!</p>

<p>"I have an invitation for you to take an airing
in the elegant turn-out of our pet senator, by the
side of his queenly wife, this p.m., at four." The
bustling housekeeper said this amid the superintending
of the dinner arrangements. "You will
go, of course, and so I told the servant who brought
in the card. You are looking so pale and thin that
I am sure the ride will do you good."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>At the hour appointed the carriage stood before
the door, and the senator's wife called out pleasantly,
as the two ladies appeared in sight, "the air is
delicious, Mrs. Southey, and I can fully recommend
its sanitary powers, having been cured of an
oppressive headache already. You are not looking
as well as usual," she continued, as the lady addressed
tripped down the stone steps where the footman
was waiting to hand her into the carriage.</p>

<p>"Will it reach the heart and conscience and
drive out its ailments?" queried the hostess.</p>

<p>The thin lips of Mrs. Southey parted slightly
as she threw back a keen glance at the speaker in
the doorway. Without apparently noticing it she
continued, "If I thought it would I would order a
carriage and perform some long-neglected duties."</p>

<p>It was a lovely afternoon, as the senator's wife
had reported, and as Mrs. Southey reclined dreamily
in one corner of the luxurious barouche, a sensation,
almost peaceful, came stealing over her
while she listened to the agreeable words of her
companion, and felt the cool soft breezes playing
about her. For a while, at least, she forgot herself
with all the attending perplexities of her situation,
in the musical clatter of the horses' hoofs on the
hard road. At last she was waked from her reveries
as from a dream, by observing the carriage stop in
the street and hearing her companion accost some
one outside.</p>

<p>"I am happy to meet you," she said; "I have
been so anxious about your patient. How is he
getting along?"</p>

<p>"Slowly improving," came back the answer.</p>

<p>"<i>Good heavens! That voice!</i>" How the guilty
woman trembled! It was that of her only daughter&mdash;her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Lillian! Did she long to clasp again
that form, once so beloved, in her maternal embrace?
Why did her cheeks and lips suddenly
become chill and pallid? Why should every
nerve quiver as she sat there mute with a palsying
fear? Ah, she well knew that a pair of large
dark eyes were fastened upon her, reading the
emotions of her very soul, avoid them as she
would! In vain did she endeavor to adjust her
veil, which was thoughtlessly thrown back from
her face in her dream of peace; but it became entangled
with the trimmings of her bonnet, and it
was impossible to disengage it. With a sensation
of despair she settled back as far as possible among
the shadows and painfully waited for the issue.</p>

<p>"Then you will come to-morrow?" she heard
Lillian say. "I want much to see you for more
than one reason."</p>

<p>"I think I will not fail," was the cheerful
answer.</p>

<p>"Then I will tell him. The prospect, I am
sure, will speed his convalescence."</p>

<p>The carriage moved on. The crouching figure
straightened a little for a freer breath.</p>

<p>"Did you see those beautiful eyes?" asked her
companion turning towards her. "I beg your
pardon!" was the impulsive exclamation as she
looked into the face beside her. "I ought not to
have kept you out so long. You look as though
you were chilled through; we will return immediately!"</p>

<p>"O, no! I am not cold! A sudden&mdash;dizziness
I think&mdash;must have come over me! Do not return;
indeed&mdash;I am not cold&mdash;the ride is exceedingly
pleasant! Let us go on."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>Her listener was surprised. Never had she seen
the aristocratic Mrs. Southey so beside herself.
Her words and manner perplexed her, still she
made no reply.</p>

<p>"The young lady&mdash;who was she? Her eyes?
O, yes! They were very fine! I think I must
have seen her before!"</p>

<p>"At the hospital then," was the reply; "for she
seldom goes out. I must tell you about her. She
has been in Alexandria, doing good service I believe,
and has now come to the city to nurse her
husband, who is badly wounded and was brought
thither for better accommodations, as he is an officer
in high rank and is much needed in the field."</p>

<p>"Her husband!" almost shrieked the miserable
woman; "did you say her <i>husband</i>?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! Why not? Do you know her?
You astonish me by your looks and appearance!
Enlighten me, I beseech you, Mrs. Southey!" exclaimed
the lady.</p>

<p>The wretched woman tried to speak, but found
not the power to do so.</p>

<p>At last she gasped, "I beg your pardon! I am
strangely nervous to-day, I confess. It is true, I
thought at first that I had seen the lady some
years ago, but conclude I must have been mistaken
or she would have remembered me. The
mother of the one she so much resembles is a very
dear friend of mine and her marriage was clandestine
and seriously against her parents' wishes. I
knew that the news of their reunion would greatly
distress them, and so allowed my sympathies to run
away with me and frighten you. You will pardon
me?" she interrogated, beseechingly, as she laid
her hand on her companion's arm.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;"><a name="Did_you_say_her_husband" id="Did_you_say_her_husband"></a>
<img src="images/fig320.jpg" width="375" height="600" alt="&quot;Did you say her husband?&quot;" title="&quot;Did you say her husband?&quot;" />
<span class="caption smcap">&quot;Did you say her husband?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly. I do not wonder at your agitation!
But really, I think your friend ought not to distress
herself about her daughter's choice were it
so. Colonel Hamilton is one of our noblest and
most heroic officers, and it is now being whispered
in military circles that as soon as he is recovered
his promotion will be speedy to the rank of brigadier,
whether he is ever able to occupy it or not.
I wish you would go with me to-morrow and see
him. He is certainly one of the finest looking
men I ever saw!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Southey, however, declined the honor.
She was "too weak and sensitive to endure excitement,"
as she had given abundant proof during
the last hour.</p>

<p>It was true, and the lady accepted the refusal
gracefully. "Sometime you must tell me more
about this colonel's wife in whom we both are so
much interested, will you?" she asked, as they
reached the street where was Mrs. Southey's
temporary home.</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to keep you informed as to
his recovery, and will call as soon as possible after
my next visit to the hospital."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" and so they parted.</p>

<p>How little either knew of the emotions or convictions
of the other! What a long catalogue of
ills were being chronicled in the inner chamber of
the guilty soul! It was a slight peep the penetrating
eyes caught through the partially opened
door ere the power of self-control returned to close
it, but no sophistry could dispose of the horrors
thus revealed! When again in her room she
dropped into an easy chair evidently exhausted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your ride must have been wearisome," suggested
her hostess. "You do not look as well as
when you went out," she continued, carelessly,
raising her eyes from the paper she had in her
hand.</p>

<p>"I am not well," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"Have you been driven under a halter? One
would imagine that justice had been close upon
you;" and she turned the page with perfect <i>sang
froid</i>.</p>

<p>"Be merciful, I beseech you!" was the plaintive
wail of her companion. "I will tell you all! I
have not been chased by <i>justice</i> as you intimate,
but what is worse&mdash;I have seen Lillian and she
has seen me! The carriage stopped while the two
friends talked, and all the time her eyes were fixed
upon my uncovered face; and to-morrow they meet
at the hospital! I know my uncontrollable agitation
has betrayed much, and there is little doubt
but she will finish what I have so ignobly begun.
Beside this my daughter has found her husband,
who is none other than the Colonel Hamilton of
whom so much has been said of late! Of course
he will aid her in performing what she would
never have the strength to accomplish herself!"
The head of the wretched mother sank upon her
hand, while her whole frame shook with emotion.
Her companion had risen and now stood before
her.</p>

<p>"The time has come when you must leave!"
she said with a tone as ringing and metallic as the
clinking of steel when rudely smiting its fellow.
"I have the arrangements all made, expecting it
would come to this, for, as you are well aware, it
would not be very comfortable for the innocent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
be found in such bad company!" The tall figure
became erect as her keen eyes were fixed upon the
face of the speaker, while she continued: "Send
your usual message and add in postscript a command
to get that horse ready as ordered and
brought around at eleven to the spot designated.
I have a suit prepared, and at about ten miles
there is a friend who will grant you a retreat for
the present. I can send you word when you must
fly farther. Now I will leave you, for it is nearly
six and the order must be written immediately!"</p>

<p>Alone! What dismal horrors haunt the guilty
mind when let loose upon itself! A spy! And
in the enemy's country, hemmed in by the barriers
of war with no way of escape to a land of safety,
if such a place could be found! A rebel! And
truth all ready to whisper in the ear of offended
justice "behold the traitor!"</p>

<p>"Where is my strength? My pride?" she
murmured, as she arose and walked across the
room. "How I tremble! The gallows! What
a reward for my persevering and arduous labors!
I understand it!"</p>

<p>Then her mind wandered to the story of a German
monarch who caused the executioner to blow
his death-blast before the door of his brother's
palace. "Ah, you tremble," said the king, "when
the prospect of temporal death is so near; but look
a little farther and behold the eternal pangs of the
soul! How now? Does the sight appall thee?
Go to thy home, my brother, the king desires not
thy life; but remember the errors of a temporal
death and shun the horrors of the second!"</p>

<p>"If I had done this! O, Lillian, Lillian my
child! You cannot see your mother at this hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and it is well! The first&mdash;yes the second death is
for such as I!"</p>

<p>"I shall do no such thing!" she exclaimed
aloud at last as she reseated herself by the window.
"The horse perish with its rider! I want neither;
I swear it! This hateful business stops here! O
wretched, wretched woman that I am! Who shall
deliver me from the body of this death? Was not
that in the Bible? Ah, I remember! The voice
that has been silent for many years once repeated
those words in my hearing when his hour had
come. The Bible! I will go to Philadelphia.
Mrs. Cheevers will not turn me from her door for&mdash;for&mdash;she
is a Christian! Pride? Away with it!
O the curse of a false ambition!"</p>

<p>The shadows of twilight fell noiselessly about
her, spreading over the bent figure a pall of tender
sympathy. Then she arose, lighted the gas and
hurriedly threw into her trunks the plain, rich
wardrobe of the elegant "English lady," and locking
them prepared to go out. She had remembered
that the northern train left the depot at eight, and
she was going upon it! She passed out without
interruption, and in a half hour the drayman was
standing in the hall ready to be shown where the
trunks were waiting. "This way," called Mrs.
Southey; "you will need help for they are large."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked the lady of the
house with great astonishment, opening the parlor
door. "Surely you are not going to tear yourself
away so abruptly? How lonely I shall be without
my aristocratic English guest! But do tell me,
where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Out of death unto life," was the quick reply.
"This way! Do not mar the railing;" and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
two men passed on with the last trunk. "Forty
minutes before train time, I believe?" she interrogated
as she stepped forward to close the door.
"Yes, madam;" and she turned to the bewildered
woman who was silently gazing at her.</p>

<p>"Well, I am going," she said calmly; "it matters
not to you where, but remember this! If
there is a path for such as I back to womanhood I
am determined to find it!" A cynical laugh was
her only response. "Nevertheless, it is true! The
miseries of the last few days have completed the
grave into which I have cast my pride and ambitions;
would that the bitter memories of the past
could be buried with them! But I must go.
Farewell&mdash;do not wait to attempt your own rescue
until the quicksands have swallowed you up;
again farewell!"</p>

<p>Her companion did not speak, but turned coldly
away, while Mrs. Belmont, with a heart lighter
than it had been for many months, tripped down
the steps. New resolutions had taken possession
of her soul, and with them had entered a ray of
cheering light. The door had been thrown ajar
for the spirit of penitence, but how dark the long
closed chamber appeared, how ghostly the spectral
memories that crouched among its shadows! The
"broken and contrite heart" had not as yet opened
the windows to the glories of the noonday sun of
righteousness; and the door was reclosed, and
upon the outside the new resolves were laid with
trembling hands. She was Mrs. Belmont again&mdash;the
mistress of Rosedale, and nevermore would
she stoop to fraud or ignominy! Her daughter
would come to her and ask for the mother-love her
disobedience had forfeited, and she would humbly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
grant it! Colonel Hamilton was not one to be
ashamed of; and then the dark night at the seashore,
the cry of the abducted Lily rolled its burden
of remorse close where the new resolutions
were lying, and she trembled as the engine
whistled its frightful alarm&mdash;something was on
the track! "O God! What if Thy anger should
fall upon me, where O where shall the sinner appear?"
burst from her lips as she covered her face
with her hands.</p>

<p>"There is no danger," shouted the brakeman at
last; "the track is clear." And with folded hands
she rode on breathing freely once more.</p>

<p>How the circumstances of life throw us about!
Now, upon the revolving wheel, we are raised high
above our fellows, where, from our dizzy elevation,
we look about us with a sense of giddiness lest
we fall; then with sudden revolution we descend
while those upon the low grounds are carried up.
Change! Change!</p>

<p>Our little circle of actors in the present drama
were on the "wheel," but not one experienced more
disagreeable sensations in its turnings than did
Mrs. Belmont, the once haughty mistress of Rosedale.
Hers was not alone in the experience of external
disagreeables; but in her soul, where the continual
revolvings of the corresponding whirlings
of good resolutions and evil passions, which the
hand of avarice was turning. Poor soul; with
only such a power to govern its weal or woe!</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaylord lingered about the maelstrom
where her darling had disappeared from sight
many weeks, loth to believe that she would not rise
again to bless and cheer her loneliness. "She was
so like me," she would repeat over and over again;
"the same restless ambitions, the same longings
after something her hand could never reach! And
now she is gone! I could bear it if the beautiful
casket, emptied of its treasure had been left for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
stricken heart to cherish and lay away in its bed
of flowers under the green grass; but to lose all
but the memory of her uncertain fate! This is
the darkest cloud of all. Then what will Willie,
the poor struggling cripple, say? How shall I
ever meet him."</p>

<p>The shadows deepened in the home of the St.
Clair's, and none rejoiced more when the husband
bore his weeping wife back to her Virginia life
than did the sympathizing Mrs. Mason. "It was
dreadful," she said to her mother, after the good-byes
were over; "but as we could not help it
became a trifle monotonous,&mdash;this petting and
soothing."</p>

<p>"Well, as for me, I would give a pretty large
sum to know the whole of that transaction," remarked
Mr. St. Clair, one day as the whole matter
was being talked over. "There is a wheel within
a wheel or I am mistaken. These old eyes are not
so very blind when they have their spectacles on."</p>

<p>"I do wish you would never again throw out one
of your wild and foolish 'perhaps so's!" exclaimed
the wife pettishly. "I should not be surprised if
your cousin should bring you before the courts for
slander."</p>

<p>The husband threw up his broad hands high
above his head while a merry peal of laughter
rang through the apartment.</p>

<p>"Only to think, wife! Slander! I tell you there
are chapters in that woman's life that she would
not like to have me or any one else be fumbling
over, and there is not much danger that she will
ever turn the leaves for my especial benefit."</p>

<p>"You are too bad; the mother of Lillian Belmont
ought to be above such insinuations, Mr. St. Clair!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a fact, but she is not, and there is
where the too bad comes in;" and the merry laugh
again resounded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaylord reached her home in safety. It
was a fine old residence, standing back from the
highway, nearly hidden from the passer by because
of the large wide-spreading trees with which it was
surrounded; yet the broadly-paved walks that
branched off in every direction as they wound
around among the cool shadows of the overhanging
branches were delightfully inviting to the
weary traveler who looked in upon them. The
mistress of that pleasant retreat now, however,
walked with languid step up the winding path to
the house with a heavy heart. The darker shades
of an overhanging gloom oppressed her. On the
portico the servants were collected to give her welcome,
and as she took the tawny hand of each
in her own, said, "You too will miss your young
mistress. You loved her, Jenny,&mdash;she will make
no more turbans for you, Phebe&mdash;and poor little
Pegs! who will fix his kite or teach him how to
spin his top?"</p>

<p>"Whar is she Missus?" asked Phebe, with the
great tears rolling down her ebony cheeks, and
several other voices chimed in "Dar&mdash;dar&mdash;Missus,
whar is she?"</p>

<p>"Dead! Swallowed up by the big sea, and we
shall see her no more!" She passed on, for Mr.
Gaylord had taken her arm and was leading her
into the long drawing-room, where he bade her stop
her prating and making a simpleton of herself.</p>

<p>"It might as well be she as any one," he continued,
noticing the look of distress on the pale
face; "Seldom could there be found a young lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
of her attractions who would break fewer hearts
by disappearing than would she. But I am sorry
for you. There was a little more color in your
face, and a slight return of the former sprightliness
in your manner while she was with you. But
she is gone, Mrs. Gaylord, and what is the use of
throwing misery over every one who crosses your
path because of it? If you must pine away the
few attractions you have left out of your life, why,
do it silently and alone."</p>

<p>Her tears ceased at the commencement of this little
sympathetic(?) speech and she now stood before
her husband cold and chilling. Servants came and
went with little acts of attention and considerable
bustle of ceremony, yet, with her arm resting upon
the marble mantel, she moved not, for her thoughts
had driven away her weariness. A visitor was
announced and she turned to see that her husband
had seated himself by the window with his paper,
and was deep in the perplexing problems it had
brought to him.</p>

<p>"War! War!" Its columns were full. Preparations
were going on everywhere. Calls were
made for every lover of his country and home to
see to it that his powers, of whatever sort, were immediately
put in working order. He yawned as
he turned to the last page, and looked up as if supposing
his lady was still present, and he had
something to say to her, but he was alone. "Well,"
he said, between the snatches of a military air
which he was whistling; "I must away. 'The
bugle sounds to arms, to arms,' and Fred Gaylord
can as well be spared from the loving embraces
of his adorable spouse as any one. Heigho!
'The echos are ringing alarms, alarms.' Hello,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
my good fellow! Nero, come and greet your master,"
and the huge mastiff walked boldly in
through the open window, and with many demonstrations
of pleasure licked the hand that caressed
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Gaylord," he said the next morning
as they were sitting at the breakfast table, "in a
week I shall go to Richmond!"</p>

<p>"To join the army?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no! I cannot say as I have any particular
desire to set up this six feet of flesh and
bones as a target for designing men to shoot at!
It wouldn't be comfortable, you know! Besides, I
can do a better thing for my country. Mine is to
plan, advise and superintend. There will be plenty
of this work to do, and you will get along very
well without me." He arose and sauntered out
into the open air, whistling as he went "the girl I
left behind me." The wife watched the manly
figure until it disappeared among the trees.</p>

<p>"Not much nobility in the character of a
coward," she thought, as she looked after him.
"Our grandest and noblest men in the South, as
well as in the North, will enter the field of battle
and&mdash;yes, will die and be buried! Hearts will
ache and homes will be saddened, and the great
wheel of destiny will keep on turning just as if
nothing unusual was happening! Lives are being
continually thrown upon it, and as rapidly hurled
by its flying motion into darkness&mdash;into forgetfulness!
Where is it? Where do they go? Where
is Lily? That soul so full of longings, of ambitious,
of unbounded faiths, hopes and shadowy desires,
real to itself but mysterious to the uninitiated?
Surely such a being has not been cast away among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the rubbish of past ages as worthless, to find in
the darkness the end of all these? No! no! She
was right! There is something in these compounds
of humanity that are not easily satisfied
and cannot readily be extinguished. My own
wild, restless cravings tell me this! Why should
this 'hungering and thirsting' be given me if there
was nothing with which to satisfy it? I once
foolishly imagined that wealth and position would
do this, but I starve with it all! I have said in
my heart, 'eat, drink, and be merry; get the
brightest things out of life that are possible, for
the end cometh.' O Lily, my child! How much
I need you! The shadows were lifting&mdash;there was
a faint light in the east, the glimmering of a new
day; but the darkness has set in again, the night
is not ended!" She was listlessly walking up and
down the elegant parlors as these thoughts ran
through her mind.</p>

<p>Weeks passed. Mr. Gaylord had long been
away, swallowed up in the excitements and business
of war, and she seldom heard from him; still she
had no fears, for he was only "planning, engineering
and advising!" This was safe business surely!
The grand old house had been filled with friends
and relatives who had fled from the immediate
scenes of action to take refuge out of harm's way;
still when the hot July days were come with their
enervating oppressiveness Mrs. Gaylord thought
of the quiet village inn at the north where she
had first met her Lily, and her heart pined for its
cooling shades once more. But the husband had
said she must not attempt to go into the enemy's
country, or she would be taken for a spy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>"However," she thought one day, "I will write
to Mr. Bancroft and hear about Willie; this will
do me a little good at least." She did write. The
tumults of war increased. The reports of conflicts
were heard everywhere! The dark wave was rolling
up from the far south and threatening to
sweep over the boundary lines east and west,
scorching and destroying everything in its progress.
Mrs. Gaylord watched its coming with a
great fear stirring her whole being. What would
become of them? Then there came an answer to
her letter. How greedily she broke the seal; how
her heart bounded as she unfolded the well-filled
sheet!</p>

<p>"How glad I was to hear from you," it began.
"I did not know but you had been lost in the terrible
fire! How it rages! Where will it end?
When the passions of men become aroused Justice
and Mercy must fold their arms and wait. But,
my dear Mrs. Gaylord, cruelties, wrong dealings,
abominations are not confined to war or kept
within the machinations of my own sex. You
speak of your loss and loneliness&mdash;come to us.
You will be happier here, and a great problem
still unsolved requires your aid. Next week a
friend of mine will go to Washington for a few
days only; now if you can get through Baltimore
meet him there and he will conduct you safely to
my home. I will see him to-day and write the
particulars to-morrow. Willie is not with me just
now, there being greater attractions elsewhere.
All will be explained when you are with us. It is
best that you should follow out my suggestions.
I should have written you many weeks ago if I
had not heard that you were not at home, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
was very uncertain whether a letter would find
you in these troublesome times."</p>

<p>"How strangely he writes," she thought, as the
paper dropped from her hand. "A problem! He
had heard I was not at home; who told him?
Why am I needed to help solve the problem?
There is a mystery in all this! It is not like him.
I must&mdash;yes, I will go! Mr. Gaylord's brother's
widow, who must remain here with her family,
should do all that I could, and I must go!" How
restlessly she tossed upon her pillow that night!
The problem! The mystery! Mr. Gaylord might
not like it; he had told her to remain where she
was; but something within bade her go. Another
letter came, as was expected. There was much
advise, counsel and many directions, and then it
said: "I will just add for your perusal a short
preface to a most exciting story. It may be that
the interest it will awaken will have more power
to draw you than anything I can say by way of
persuasion. You know that there is an assurance
somewhere that 'the sea shall give up its dead,'
and that we 'shall meet our loved ones,' etc.
These are, without doubt, true, for we have many
a foretaste of the good things to come even here.
One to the point is fresh before me. More than
two months ago Willie received a letter from over
the ocean that the good ship Constitution had
picked up from off the dark billows a floating waif
alone in an open boat somewhere along the southern
shore, and as they were bound for Liverpool
had no alternative but to take their prize with
them. They did so and it was then lying in a
hospital very sick, and the greater part of the time
delirious. The physicians, however, had prophesied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
a speedy recovery when the crisis was passed,
and as they had succeeded in learning the address
of the one about whom she had talked almost incessantly,
concluded to write to him. 'Be not
alarmed' it went on to say, 'for it was not strange
that such a night on the billows of a stormy sea
should have upset a stronger set of nerves, or bewildered
even a more massive brain.' But she
would recover, and when strong enough would be
brought back to Boston where her home was, as
they had gathered from her talk. Still it was their
desire to hear immediately if a young lady had
been missing from those parts; a Miss 'Lily Gaylord',
the name found on the clothing."</p>

<p>"My Lily!" almost shrieked the excited woman
unable to read farther. "Preserved again! What
a wonderful power is holding her! But how did
she come on the sea? This is the problem&mdash;O,
who can solve it?" Her burning eyes again fell
upon the paper.</p>

<p>"And now she is with Willie in their old home.
I was there a few days ago and found her very
pale and thin. I told her I was going to insist
that you should come north, when her dark eyes
brightened and she said, 'O do!' Her story told
Willie is a strange one; more wonderful than fiction.
But you will come now, and so I will reserve
the rest until your arrival."</p>

<p>Did she go? How laggard were the days that
intervened between the receipt of this letter and
the "next Thursday week" when she was to meet
Mr. Bancroft's friend in Washington. Then she
thought it all over. The strange incidents concerning
the disappearance of her darling; the suspicions
so abruptly spoken by Mr. St. Clair on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
that sad evening! True, he was excited and
might have said what he did not feel; but Mrs.
Belmont's unsatisfactory explanations as to why
she should be out in such a place, at such a time,
with no other attendant than a cowardly servant,
was all such a mystery! Why should that lady
wish to injure the child? Had she not said on
several occasions that she "had taken a fancy
to the dear girl?" Yes, several times! And this
was nothing strange; everybody admired her!
Certainly she had done nothing to the mistress of
Rosedale to excite in her a desire to do her harm!
It could not be! The more she thought it over,
the more she recalled half-forgotten looks and
words, the more was she perplexed.</p>

<p>"I will wait," she thought at last; "perhaps
Lily can throw a little light upon the transaction.
Whatever were the designs of Mrs. Belmont, Lily
is safe! More than ever now will she believe that
a mighty hand kept her above the dark billows!
Twice has she ridden alone and unguided upon
them, yet she did not sink! The picture in the
old Bible in the library, which I have pondered so
many times, seems to impress itself now upon my
soul. Like Peter, Jesus must have walked beside
her, upheld and guided the frail boat with its
precious freight; and it may be&mdash;it may be He
spoke to the angry deep 'peace, be still'! I wish
I believed it all. How cheering it must be&mdash;such
faith I mean&mdash;to the lone mariner on the dark billows
of life to be cared for by one who can do
these things! Hush the storms and command
the waves and they obey Him! I think I should
not toss about in my little boat as hopelessly, or
shudder with such fear as I look out over the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
waters that are rolling about me, if this faith were
mine. O Lily! So like me, yet so far removed,
with the great God of heaven for your father, and
the Saviour for your friend and protector! I will
know more of this! I am disappointed, hungry
and thirsty. The waters are deep; the waves
dash upon my frail bark!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaylord arrived safely in Boston, after a
very wearisome journey and was met by Mr. Bancroft
with many demonstrations of delight.</p>

<p>"It will please Willie so much," he said, after
it was well over, by way of apology. "That gentle
little cripple of yours, Mrs. Gaylord," he continued,
"has taken a long hitch into my affections,
and it does me good to gratify his whims."</p>

<p>"They are together, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, out on the farm. I was there last week
and told them you were coming, although I was
not positive in the matter as I would like to have
been; but I guessed it! You know that is our
Yankee privilege."</p>

<p>No amount of persuasion could induce the lady
to remain in the city for a rest; she must go at
once! "What a sad time poor Lily must have
had of it. I am so anxious to hear all about it!"</p>

<p>"Your curiosity will not gain any great corpulency
by what she can tell you, I imagine," he
laughed. "She seems very reticent when touching
the supposed reasons for her ride, and it is my
opinion that there was more in the tender solicitude
of that precious friend she found down south
than was discernable to the naked eye!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was there ever an open transgression, or an
imaginary evil perpetrated that a woman was not
at the bottom of it?" Mrs. Bancroft made this
little speech in the form of an inquiry with a very
smiling face, and a mischievous twinkle in her
blue eyes. "There is my good husband, for instance,
who declared this very morning that if you
did not come, it would be because I did not more
positively insist! Just as though you did not
know how much I loved you years ago, and, although
a woman, love you still!"</p>

<p>"But she has come, wife," interposed the laughing
husband, "and, no doubt, is tired and hungry.
You will wait until morning before proceeding
farther?" he queried, turning to the visitor.</p>

<p>"I shall be obliged to, I suppose, for, if I remember
correctly, there is but one more train in
that direction to-night, and that is at five, while it
is nearly four now."</p>

<p>The following morning, on the first train going
west was Mrs. Gaylord, with her dusky-browed
companion, who seldom was apart from her mistress.
Now they were going to the little village
for the third time, where both had spent so many
pleasant days. "We will take dinner there," the
lady had said, "and then I will go for a drive and
find Lily."</p>

<p>Tiny had said nothing, but her eyes were open
as well as those of her mistress; and now a smile
came and lingered around the well-formed mouth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaylord saw it.</p>

<p>"How do you imagine Miss Lily came out on
the ocean that dark night, Tiny? There is that
at times in your face which leads me to think you
know something about it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>"O no, Missus; Tiny don't know nothin'; she
'spect tho', dat de good Lord didn't take her dar."</p>

<p>"But He took her off, Tiny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Missus, He duz that, but He neber got nobody
to carry her dar."</p>

<p>"Did any one do that?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, but I'se see Missus Belmont talkin'
to a white trash more'n once, and I 'spects
somthin'."</p>

<p>"Who were they, Tiny?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't tell; 'twas drefful dark down on
secon' street, but I know'd her. I went wid Cassa
down to see Pliny, what was sick, and she was dar
by de carriage shop talkin'."</p>

<p>Perplexities thickened. If she had done this,
why was it done? There must have been a reason
for such a terrible act!</p>

<p>The whistle blew, and the train stopped at the
junction. Carriages were waiting, and into one
stepped Mrs. Gaylord, followed by her servant.</p>

<p>"Ah! Glad to see you at Kirkham again."</p>

<p>The lady turned quickly. "O, it is you, Frank.
How warm you are here. Drive on, there is a cool
breath waiting for me under the maples."</p>

<p>With the sensation of unburdening, Mrs. Gaylord
went out before dinner into the pleasant grove
in the rear of the hotel, where she found the cool
breath waiting. Here, at least, the war could not
reach her! The sound of strife, of anger or oppression
could not search her out! The first great
battle had been fought, and there was mourning as
well as exultation in the land, while the blood of
patriots was at boiling heat. Was it this that oppressed
her? Had she grieved at the result, or
had her Southern tendencies made it joy? She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
asked herself this question more than once; and
as she sat under the shadows of the whispering
trees, concluded that, let the results be what they
would, she loved the cool, unimpassioned Northerners,
with their independence and self-sustaining
powers. She would wait. She had found peace in
days gone by as she looked calmly out over the
waste of waters whither she was floating, and felt
no hard throbbings of the heart where love was
dying! Would this peace come again? Not until
she had seen Lily, and the mysterious problem
solved should she look for it. She did not like this
tangling up of broken threads; indeed, she did
not want them to break at all; but, since they
must, why could they not dangle free from each
other?</p>

<p>Soon after dinner, and while the sun was still
high, the carriage came around for her.</p>

<p>"Going to see the cripple, Willie Evans?" interrogated
the driver from the box, with all the
northern familiarity. "His sister is back again,
and a hard time she's had of it; so they say;"
he continued, for the lady had not answered. She
spoke now.</p>

<p>"She was with me, you remember, at the
hotel."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, ma'am, I remember! There is something
strange about her adventure, but I dare say
it will in time be all explained."</p>

<p>She had not liked the way the simple-minded
man gave his information. What if, after all, gossip,
should burden her shoulders with the strange
rumors. She had not thought of this! How
would she be received at the cottage? Would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Willie blame her? But Lily had told all! She
certainly would relieve her from censure.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped at the gate and Mrs. Hopkins
appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Are the young people at home?" inquired the
lady without moving from her seat.</p>

<p>"They have gone for a short walk to the lake,
but will be back soon," was the reply. "Mrs.
Gaylord, I believe? They will be glad to see
you! You had better come in and I will send for
them."</p>

<p>"I will go," said the driver; and Mrs. Gaylord
stepped from her carriage and entered the little
parlor.</p>

<p>"You will find that the girl is much changed,"
remarked Mrs. Hopkins, handing the lady a chair.
"She is very thin and pale. She has been
seriously ill, and I do not wonder! It <i>was</i> dreadful!
Her being out all night in that terrible
storm; and in an open boat all alone! I tell her
that she had better stay where her <i>friends</i> are
now, if it <i>is</i> in the lower walks of life! She has
some very foolish notions that, in my opinion, she
would be much better without." Mrs. Hopkins
had taken a seat close by the window, and seemingly
was communing with herself rather than
entertaining her visitor. Mrs. Gaylord allowed
her to proceed without interruption. "She is
poor, homeless and friendless, and the sooner she
makes up her mind to settle down to these facts
and go to work, the happier she will be."</p>

<p>"I think you are a little mistaken about her
poverty, friendships or home, for to my certain
knowledge she has all. At any rate she can have
them by the acceptance."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems that she did accept, and you see how
it has turned out. She comes back without clothes
or health and ready to seek shelter in the home
she once so foolishly left. Still," she continued,
as she espied a flush of indignation sweeping over
the face of her listener, "I have much to thank
you for in regard to my poor brother. He is very
happy in being able to earn his board and provide
for his own necessities. It was kind in you to bestow
such happiness on a poor cripple. We had
never thought it possible that he could ever be
anything but a burden." The lady moved nervously.
"Of course we were willing to take care of
him, but it's so much pleasanter for one to take care
of himself. Mr. Bancroft has seemingly taken a
great liking to him. He was out here last week
and wanted he should hurry through with his
vacation as he was lonely, so he said. I thought
the change would be bad for him, but he has
grown quite fleshy and is looking well." The
voice ceased, for suddenly she had awakened to
the consciousness that she was talking all alone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaylord was busy with her thoughts.
This then was the Fanny of whom Lily had told
her. What wonder that her sensitive nature had
shrank from her! Such exhibitions of a selfish
spirit! It was not strange the atmosphere of such
a home had chilled and frozen her warm, tender
affections. But it was over. She should not remain
a day longer where such storms of frost and
snow must continually pelt her! She was indignant.
"Glad to get back to the home she had
left" without friends or clothing! She looked up
and saw a pair of stern eyes fixed upon her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, I was wandering with my
thoughts just then." "And I was waiting for them
to come back," was the response. "Of course you
will let the girl remain now where she rightfully
belongs? She can help me and pay her way if
she feels so disposed, and it's time that she should.
If she is let alone I have no doubt she will make
quite a woman. She wanted to see you and I had
no objections; but you had better not trouble
yourself farther about her. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"I can answer your question better at nightfall,"
Mrs. Gaylord replied, ironically. "I shall
take them both with me to the hotel if they will
go, and after talking the matter over can conclude
with greater wisdom."</p>

<p>"Of course they will! Some people are very
willing to seek for aid when helpless and in
trouble, but have no idea of returning the favors
received when an opportunity is offered for them
to do so!"</p>

<p>The little party were coming up the garden
walk and Mrs. Gaylord arose to meet them. With
a bound and a cry of pleasure Lily sprang into
the open arms ready to receive her.</p>

<p>"O Lily, Lily, my darling!" exclaimed the
sweet voice, while the lips that spoke these words
were kissing brow and cheek passionately. Willie
was hitching himself over the green grass
towards them. "You are changed! How very
sick you must have been!" and she held the weeping
girl off at arm's length that she might look at
her. "Get yourself ready, as the carriage must
be back to the hotel in three hours and it is nearly
two already." She stepped forward and clasped
the cripple's extended hand. "It makes me more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
happy than I can tell to meet you both again.
You will go with us? I so pine for one of our old
talks duplicated. Frank, help Willie to the carriage."
And she turned to find that Lily had
disappeared, and in her place stood the veritable
Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>"I do not want you to think," she said, meekly,
"that I am not willing that you should be her
friend, but I do think that if you are, you will advise
her to remain in her present home, where she
seems to have been placed, and not attempt to be
what she is not or ever can be!"</p>

<p>Lily's appearance put an end to further conversation,
and without a moment's delay the horses
were turned towards the village.</p>

<p>"You see I have changed my plumage," Lily
said with a smile. "I returned to Boston with a
very small wardrobe, only what had been provided
for me at the hospital by some kind visitors, and
Willie out of his little accumulations insisted upon
this French lawn, which I keep for my 'dress-up.'
It is very pretty, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it seems to me that you have not
'picked up' as much as you ought in three
months. You are looking much thinner than I
had thought of finding you!"</p>

<p>"It is such a mystery! I cannot sleep! That
voice in the darkness under the trees that called
me so feebly and with such perfect indifference!
This haunts me whenever I close my eyes. The
whole scene; the masked face, the rolling billows,
the sound of the huge waves as they dashed
against the rocks; all, all terrify and distract me!
How can the flesh ever creep back upon my bones
or the color to my cheek or lips? O that terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
night! Its horrors even as I recall them well
nigh curdle my blood!"</p>

<p>"Poor child!" But Willie interrupted them.</p>

<p>"It is only two years, or a little more, since we
rode together over this road. Dear old Rover; he
must have one drive to the village before he returns
to his city life. I do not think he likes it as well
as his master, Mrs. Gaylord," he continued, with an
air of pleasantry.</p>

<p>"We understand you, Willie," Lily laughed,
wholly recalled from her dark remembrances.
"Two years, and very eventful ones too; but Rover
must have his pleasure now as well as we."</p>

<p>The horses trotted briskly forward, and very
little more was said until the trio were cosily seated
in the little upper parlor of the inn.</p>

<p>"My child, I conclude, from one little remark
you have made, that Mrs. Belmont, in your opinion,
knew something of the sad affair before the
hour in which you were carried away."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do believe it!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You would not have asked had you noticed her
while we were sitting on the sofa, the first time of
our meeting at the Washburn's, when she quizzed
me about my early life,&mdash;my parentage, and my
fanciful name of 'Lily Pearl,' which I took occasion
to tell her after my suspicions were aroused!
Mrs. Gaylord, she knows something of my history.
I feel it; I cannot be mistaken!"</p>

<p>"Why did you not ask her about it?"</p>

<p>"I did. When she came to my room the next
day while I was dressing for dinner, and in her
caressing way patted my neck and spoke of its
whiteness and beauty, at the same time inadvertently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
as she would evidently have me think,
bared my shoulders, and, as she did so, gave a little
shriek. As I looked up into her face I saw it
was deadly pale! 'What is it?' I asked, as calmly
as possible. 'Do those purple spots remind you
of anything?' 'Remind me? What do you mean,
child?' 'Just what I said. Do they remind you of
anything in the past? Mrs. Belmont, you know
something about me or you would not appear so
strangely. Tell me, will you? Who am I? and
where are my parents?' I was looking her directly
in the eye and she trembled under my gaze. 'You
are mistaken, my dear,' she replied blandly, 'I
have no knowledge of you whatever! How could
I? I never heard of you till last night, and certainly
never looked into your face; a very pretty one,
however, and I hope you will not spoil it by allowing
anger or unjust suspicion to creep into your
heart, for they always leave an impress upon the
countenance.' She was turning to leave the room
when I stopped her. 'This is all very well, still I
am not convinced that you are ignorant of my
early life! Why did these unusual spots upon
my shoulder startle you, as the mentioning of my
name, Lily Pearl, did last night? Why do you
gaze at me so fixedly while at the table, and shrink
with such pallor when I return the look? Tell
me, Mrs. Belmont, who am I?' 'Satan's own, I
believe,' she said furiously, as she rushed from the
room.</p>

<p>"Her manner changed after. She was kind and
conciliating; her attentions nattering to one like
myself. I feared her, yet she fascinated me! I
strove to break away from her enchantments, but
her power over my silly heart was wholly unaccounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
for. I had read somewhere of the serpent
who could charm its victim to destroy it; and I
felt that I was that victim! I could not tell, for I
did not understand it myself. It would have been
impossible to explain. And then, her manner on
that night! I feared to take that ride, but had no
power to refuse. Willie says that the Father was
permitting all this and holding my opposition in
check for some great purpose yet unforeseen,
and, as I look back upon it, wonder if it is so."</p>

<p>"Did you not get some idea from the men who
had you in charge?"</p>

<p>"No, they said but little. They had bound my
hands and threw me into the boat, supposing I had
fainted. They spoke about the impossibility of getting
to the ship in such a sea; and expressed a
little sympathy for my situation as nearly as I
could understand; but said nothing about their
reasons for doing what they had. I had succeeded
in getting my hands loose, and, without any premeditation,
pushed away from their power as they
stepped on the rocks to fasten the boat. Here I
think was where the Father took the matter
into His own hands. I was severed from all earthly
connections; had broken all human ties, and was
alone with God upon the waters! As the first
wave lifted my boat high upon its foaming crest I
cried out at the top of my voice, 'Lord, save or
I perish!' Then the billow rolled from under me
and a sweet peace came into my soul. Then I
remembered the little upper chamber at the cottage,
when one night I found that the angry billows
of life's ocean were dashing themselves
around me, and heard Willie's prayer. 'Keep her
safe, O my Father, when the troubles of this world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
fall upon her! Help her to bear them, and give
her strength to battle every storm!' Then I knew
I should not be drowned&mdash;I should be kept safely.</p>

<p>"All night the winds howled, and the sea roared,
and I was safe on the deep. But it was cold and
I was thinly dressed. I do not know at what
time the mantle of unconsciousness was thrown
over me, but it was in the early morn that the
'Constitution' picked me up. I was very ill, and
unconscious on ship-board and in the hospital, and
when sufficiently restored, they asked me 'who
was Willie and where could they find him.' I
told them. His name broke the fetters that had
bound me so long. I was better, and almost two
months ago they sent me to him. Now tell me;
what does it all mean?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h3><a name="CHANGING_CLOUDS" id="CHANGING_CLOUDS"></a>CHANGING CLOUDS.</h3>


<p>Reader, did you ever stand and watch the
waving crimson curtains hanging in the western
sky on some calm summer eve while they were
trying to shut out the glorious sunset from view?
As you wondered at their changing beauties, did
you remember that the objects of so much gorgeous
display were only cold, damp, gray clouds, unsightly
in themselves, without attraction, and that
it was only the reflection of a hidden power upon
which you were gazing with so much rapture? So
it is in our lives, and a chill, sombre day we would
have of it did not some power behind the throne
cast a few golden rays upon the clouds of gray.</p>

<p>"The problem cannot be solved!" thought Mrs.
Gaylord, as she settled down in her old life, with
Lily as her companion, after the fashion of former
days. Lily was no longer without friends, home
or clothing, as the extra large trunk in the store-room
with those of Mrs. Gaylord's amply proved.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins did not fail to express her indignation
in very characteristic style when the conclusion
was fully reached that the "girl" would
return to her former life and associations. "The
foolish thing!" she exclaimed. "One more ride,
I imagine, will finish the whole matter. I don't
see why she cannot be satisfied with well enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
She'll find out her mistake when it's too late.
One thing I am decided upon. She mustn't come
here again when thrown off by those who pretend
to be her friends. I won't have anything more to
do with her."</p>

<p>All this was said to Willie that evening after his
return from the village. "She might have stayed
here and worked to pay her way as she ought to
do. She's no better than I am, and should be
made to keep where she belongs. But that silly
woman likes her pretty face and enjoys her
reading, and so will dress her up and spoil her for
the sake of gratifying her own wishes for a little
time, and by and by will send her back, I suppose,
for me to wait upon. But she'll find herself
mistaken. I won't do it!"</p>

<p>"It seems to me, Sister, that you are making
yourself unnecessarily unhappy," replied Willie
very mildly, when Fanny had stopped for a
moment to get her breath. "I do not think that
'Phebe' will ever trouble you again. She shall
never know of this conversation, however, for I
believe when you think it calmly over you will
be sorry. It does not seem to have been any
fault of Mrs. Gaylord's that she had her unpleasant
ride, and I cannot think her foolish in the choice
she has made."</p>

<p>Mr. Hopkins coming in put an end to the conversation.
He inquired kindly if "Phebe" had
concluded to remain at the hotel?</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gaylord claims her on the old contract, I
believe," replied Willie.</p>

<p>"Sensible to the last," he supplemented. And
Fanny went on with her work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>All this time clouds were shifting in other
portions of our historical firmament, and bright
rays from behind the curtain were falling elsewhere
on damp, gray lives. Mrs. Belmont had
reached Philadelphia, and was not very agreeably
or graciously received, though her relative knew
nothing of her residence in Washington, or of the
public life she had been leading. Lillian had been
careful to throw upon her mother's actions regarding
her the brightest colors possible; still enough
had been known of the incidents of the last few
years to cast a shadow over the present reception,
and the lady felt its chilliness.</p>

<p>Anna Pierson, too, was watching the summer
sky with its chill, gray clouds, and wondering why
the misty folds sometimes crimsoned with a far-off
beauty. Her dead had been buried, and frequent
news of the absent brother told of safety. As the
days flew by, there came reports of exchange of
prisoners, of furloughs and release from hospital
treatment and restraints. These, it must be, were
the bright reflections that gilded her western sky
as she carefully watched it. Ellen St. Clair's
letters were frequent, and usually contained very
cheering reports. "George was getting better,
could sit up a little, and was as impatient and
peevish as a naughty child." Still the October
haze would paint the leaves before the exiles could
be expected at the widow's cottage.</p>

<p>"It is terribly dreary here," Ellen wrote one
day while the September rains were falling; "and
I have petitioned for a removal to other quarters,
and next week George is to be taken to Washington,
where I shall be permitted to follow. He
has fully recanted his Southern faith, and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
marked honors are being showered on him. It is
somewhat grateful to my feelings to be the sister
of so noted a personage at this time. Can you
realize it? I have stood in the presence of the
chief magistrate himself. Yes, it is true. In one
of his visits at the hospitals yesterday he was
officially escorted to our rooms by a little negro
about two feet high, and I&mdash;well, I did almost fall
in love with him. No one must ever call him ugly
in my presence. I think him decidedly good-looking.
When he said at parting, 'Miss St. Clair,
take extra good care of your brother&mdash;and yourself,'
the work was done; I am his friend for ever
more!"</p>

<p>George St. Clair bore his short transfer remarkably
well, and upon arriving in the city was placed
in the ward of convalescents, where his spirits soon
revived, notwithstanding the hard shots that were
so often thrown with unerring aim at his well-established
prejudices. Here were a few highly
educated and popular men, some of high rank in
the army, and our soldier found himself in very
congenial society.</p>

<p>Then there came another letter to the widow's
cottage, saying: "I am most ignobly discharged.
'Do not need a nurse any more,' etc., etc. So you
will greet your disconsolate daughter immediately
after a little sight-seeing."</p>

<p>It was true. All that was now required was
patience while the old strength slowly returned, and
Toby was fully capable of attending to his master's
necessities. The second morning after the
new arrival dawned cold and rainy. The poor torn
back fretted in such an atmosphere and was very
painful. Not feeling able to join the others in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the morning meal, George St. Clair returned to
his bed, and was lying moodily watching his
companions, when a lady entered, and walked directly
up to a noble-looking officer with whom he
had been much pleased the day before, but whose
name he had not learned, as all addressed him as
"Colonel." There was something strangely familiar
about that walk and movement of the head and
shoulders, and, as he had nothing better to do,
gazed at her, wishing all the time that she would
turn a little, that he might have a view of her face,
but she was busily engaged, and seemed in no
hurry to gratify our hero. All apparently had
met her before, for each received a word of greeting,
as he judged, although too far away to hear
more than the murmuring of voices. Then the
Colonel monopolized her attention, and after a moments
talk both turned abruptly in the direction
where he was reclining.</p>

<p>"Then he has been telling her of me!"</p>

<p>They moved forward. "Coming to see the
'Rebel,' no doubt. Who can she be?" That
walk! That form! They neared him. A veil
had partially covered her face, but now it was
thrown back as she sprang forward with a cry of
surprise and joy. "George St. Clair! My brother!"</p>

<p>With an impulse unusual to the young lady of
Rosedale, she clasped her arms about his neck and
kissed his forehead with a sisterly demonstration.</p>

<p>"I did not know,&mdash;I had not heard that you were
here! How glad I am to meet you."</p>

<p>"Lillian! I never was so astonished! You in
such a place as this! The delicate, frail, 'Lily
Bell?' Let me take your hand; It cannot be!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>She had stepped back from him as he spoke, and
now a low rippling laugh floated away from her
parted lips.</p>

<p>"Well, well! am I of no account?" exclaimed
her companion, joining in the laugh. "This
may be very interesting to the parties immediately
concerned, but to look mutely on is another
thing."</p>

<p>Lillian shook her finger at him menacingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, George, you remember I told you of my
husband. I have found him; Colonel Hamilton!
Two brave soldiers who have bled for their country's
weal. You will be brothers? Let me perform
the ceremony of uniting hands,&mdash;the hearts
will be sure to come together."</p>

<p>"Surprises thicken! Why did you not tell me
during our long chat last evening, that you were
the thief who robbed me of my coveted 'Lily
Bell?' All this, and yet the world moves on!
The war is developing and unraveling! What
will come next?"</p>

<p>"Not to be known as there are no headings to
the chapters!" Then there was a long talk, and
many little items of news imparted that brought
the deepening color to more than one cheek.</p>

<p>"It would, without doubt, be a little unpleasant
for me to return to my Southern home just at present,"
said St. Clair, when the conversation lagged.
"And I am told from headquarters that I shall not
be able for active service for months yet; so I
propose to go farther north where my parents are,
and, perhaps, burrow for the winter. It will be
pretty cold for Confederate blood, but it is about
the best I can do."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>"A capital idea! Get acquainted with us low
fellows,&mdash;I think you will like us when you know
us better."</p>

<p>"Have you seen Ellen?" He had turned to
Lillian now.</p>

<p>"Ellen? Is she here?"</p>

<p>"Out sight-seeing somewhere. She is to return
to her temporary home in a day or two."</p>

<p>All this time, Mrs. Hamilton had not spoken
of her mother,&mdash;not inquired for her. She had
met and recognized her; but where was she now?
For weeks she had watched for the familiar face;
had looked everywhere for the flutter of the gray
silk; and thus far it had been in vain. "Where
was she? Would she come no more?" A great
disappointment had found its way into the happy
heart, where love had for so many years been
weeping, but where all tears were now wiped away
in a blissful reunion. Lillian loved her mother.
She had been petted and fondled by her through
all her childhood's days; but the memory of the
bitter curse would creep in among her joys, dragging
after it the cold, dark shadows that for a
time would exclude the warmth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton called upon Ellen St. Clair at
her lodgings, where new interests were brought
out, and many little feminine secrets unveiled,
which tangled themselves together in a very perplexing
sort of way. The story of Lily Gaylord's
disappearance, and her father's "unjust censure
of Mrs. Belmont" was duly discussed and commented
upon.</p>

<p>"An adopted daughter, you said, of the lady?"
queried Lillian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and George said from the first that she
resembled you in many ways. Her eyes certainly
were as large and dreamy. 'Beautiful,' as Grace
would say, 'as those of my Lily Bell.' It was a
stormy night on the sea, and, as every one declared,
no small boat could keep up any length of
time, and as nothing could be heard from her, it
was concluded she must be lost," Ellen went on to
say.</p>

<p>"Dreadful! A young girl of&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Of sixteen, I believe."</p>

<p>Lillian started. "Sixteen! How strange!&mdash;and
my mother was with her&mdash;and unattended!"</p>

<p>"You seem excited; well we all were shocked!
It was so inexplicable. Such a mystery! But it
was soon forgotten in the greater interests of the
war. You know one is not missed when so many
are being lost."</p>

<p>It was Ellen who had said this, but her visitor
sat motionless, her large eyes dilated as though
striving to penetrate some dark uncertainty.</p>

<p>"I cannot but think how strange it is for you
to be here&mdash;and with a <i>husband</i>! Why did you
never tell us?"</p>

<p>"It was only one of my secrets, dear Ellen,"
was the hesitating reply. "But I am detaining
you. We are a very busy people in Washington,
and you are to leave here soon?"</p>

<p>"In three days."</p>

<p>Ellen went as she intended. It was a long, tiresome
journey to take alone, but her heart had
become brave. There was a pleasant reunion at
the widow's home on the evening of her arrival.
George was better, and the hearts of the parents
beat with a steady pulsation once more. Bertha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
and the children were well, as late letters from
the dear old home had assured them, and now
Ellen had safely returned.</p>

<p>"George will write a few words every day and
mail it once a week," was the glad response to the
inquiry as to how they were to hear from him.
"And in a month, the physician says, he will
probably be able to travel a short distance each
day, and will get to his chair at our table before it
is very cold. He has ordered me to engage rooms
for us all at the hotel for the winter, but I hate
hotels, and it is so cozy here!"</p>

<p>"Anna and I would be very lonely without you
now," interposed the widow, calmly. "Our rooms
are small, but we have a goodly number of them."</p>

<p>"And I will call it 'Maple Grove Inn' and write
that I have secured a suite of rooms ample for us
all! Bravo! And I want to learn to make pies
and cakes and put my own hands into the biscuits,
for I am a Yankee girl from henceforth! No more
black fingers in my bread. Dear old Katy," she
said, after a moment's pause. "How good everything
tasted that her poor old ebony hands made!
If I could find such a noble looking northerner as
Lillian has for her husband he wouldn't have to
ask me more than once to be his wife!"</p>

<p>"Lillian's husband, my child?" interrogated
both father and mother in a breath.</p>

<p>"Certainly; but I have not told you. One cannot
say everything in an hour!" And then the
story was reproduced with the details George had
added, having known it for months, yes almost a
year and never told it, not forgetting her abstracted
manner as the disappearance of Lily Gaylord was
rehearsed. "One might have imagined to look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
her that the girl was a near kin. She asked me
about her general appearance, and when I said
that some thought there was a very striking resemblance
between her and Mrs. Gaylord's adopted
daughter you ought to have seen the look!"</p>

<p>"You are quite imaginative, my dear," remarked
Mrs. St. Clair warmly. "It was the shock, her
mother being with Lily at the time that gave her
the look you speak of. I do not wonder, for there
was room at least for censure!"</p>

<p>"That's a fact, wife! I should like to know
where the mistress of Rosedale is keeping herself?
Bertha writes that she disappeared soon after leaving
the city, and Charles has never heard from her
since. Didn't meet her in Washington I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, Father," and a hearty laugh followed.
When quiet was restored Ellen asked: "Where
is Charles, Father?"</p>

<p>"Skulking around without doubt for fear of
being drafted, and the negroes have it all their
own way at Rosedale now, I believe."</p>

<p>That night as the mother and daughter were
left alone, the former interrupted a prolonged
silence by the abrupt question: "Anna, my child,
what about this George St. Clair? Has a secret
crept into your confiding heart that you would
keep hidden from the careful, watchful eye of
your parent? Tell me, what about this rebel
colonel?"</p>

<p>A long silence followed. At last, "I was waiting,
Mother," she said, "for my heart to be sure of
its first great lesson before imparting it to you.
But first let me tell you he is true, loyal, to the
old flag under which my brother fought and died.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
It was the circumstances of his life that has placed
him where he was, and not the convictions of his
better judgment."</p>

<p>The mother watched the beaming face. "And
you can excuse him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother, my heart pleads for him! I cannot
deny it; I do love George St. Clair! My
brother has been slain upon the altar of sacrifice,
but his hand has not the stain of his blood upon
it!" There were tears in the mild blue eyes and
the mother saw them.</p>

<p>"Does he know all this?"</p>

<p>"All, Mother! This was the storm that rolled
about me when in Alexandria. The waves dashed
high, but it cannot be wrong; I do love George
St. Clair!"</p>

<p>"Do you realize the great difference in your
social positions? You the daughter of a poor
widow&mdash;he the heir of large possessions and a
devotee to aristocracy. O my daughter, I fear for
your future happiness!" The dear face showed
the inward struggle of the mother's heart, and the
hand upon which her head was languidly resting
trembled.</p>

<p>"Wait until you see him," pleaded the daughter;
"he is good and noble!"</p>

<p>"My basket is getting full of bitter fruit in the
commencement of this terrible war; what will it be
when the harvest is wholly gathered?"</p>

<p>"Mother, have you forgotten that 'all things
shall work together for good to those who trust
God?' Can you not trust now as surely as when
you laid your two sons where the fire might consume
them?" She was standing by the side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
that mother now, and an arm had stolen softly
about her neck.</p>

<p>"I will trust Him!" came from the compressed
lips, and drawing her daughter upon her knee as
in the years gone by she looked into her flushed
face. "Whatever God wills my selfish heart will
not pronounce unkind!"</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DARKNESS_THICKENS" id="THE_DARKNESS_THICKENS"></a>THE DARKNESS THICKENS.</h3>


<p>"Pass those letters over to me, Mr. Cheevers,"
suggested the wife, as the gentlemen addressed
drew several from his pocket while waiting for
his supper. "One from New Orleans&mdash;that is
good&mdash;one from Washington! Lillian! It has
been some time since we have had such a pleasure,"
continued the lady more calmly, for she had
not intended to let Mrs. Belmont know of her
correspondence with her daughter, but her glad
surprise on this occasion had betrayed the secret.
The husband was peering over the top of his
paper at the mother as the exclamation fell on her
ear, and saw the sudden start and pallor of her
face as she endeavored to appear uninterested.
Mrs. Cheevers had opened the welcome missive
and was reading. "How strange," she murmured
as she turned the page. Mrs. Belmont stirred
uneasily in her chair. "<i>Well, I declare!</i>"</p>

<p>"A good many exclamation points;" this from
the husband, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Lillian seems very happy with her husband
and in her new vocation as nurse. How little we
ever imagined, Charlotte, that your daughter
would make such a noble woman! It takes a
good many hard winds to bring out the strength
of the 'sapling,' but it will do it!" The letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
was finished and Mrs. Cheevers sat motionless
with it lying upon her lap.</p>

<p>"No bad news, I hope?" interrogated Mrs. Belmont
with some trepidation.</p>

<p>"No. I was trying, however, to guess it out!
You did not tell us, Charlotte, that you had been
in Washington; why did you not call upon your
daughter? She writes that she saw you and has
been looking everywhere and cannot find you,
and has come to the conclusion that you are not
in the city, and then adds 'she can hardly think
of going back to Rosedale at present, as traveling
in that direction would be very unpleasant with
the whole army of the Potomac to encounter; and
I have thought perhaps she would visit you. If
she does, detain her if possible until my return to
Philadelphia. Pearl is recovering, and before cold
weather will probably go back to his duties. The
realization of that coming good-bye envelopes me
with its terrible presentiments. How can I ever
permit him to go from my sight again! You will
say I am foolish and Uncle would scold me if he
could, for I propose going with him; not as a
soldier but as assistant in the hospitals, which
will spring up in the trail of our advancing army.
But we will talk this over, when on his furlough
we visit for a few days his mother and my dear
uncle and aunt.' Now, why did you not like an
affectionate mother go to see Lillian and get an
introduction to your son-in-law?"</p>

<p>"You have explained the reason. I did not desire
to meet her husband, and having learned that
she was with him was compelled to leave the city
without going to her as I would have wished. The
time may come when my 'prejudices,' as you call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
them, can be overcome, but as yet my whole soul
recoils from the contact!"</p>

<p>Mr. Cheevers laid down his paper and laughed
ironically. "It seems to me that Irene is unusually
slow. I must get back to the store." He
walked across the floor impatiently.</p>

<p>"I will go and see what is the matter and let
Sylvia's letter go until after tea." The bell soon
rang, and while the husband was satisfying his
appetite with the evening bounties the wife ran
over Sylvia's letter.</p>

<p>"All well&mdash;but in a flutter of fearful forebodings,"
was the report as she proceeded. "Grace
is dreadfully worried about Lillian," she added
when the missive was finished. "I think the
mails are not very regular, for I sent a full report
of her doings and experiences a month ago."</p>

<p>"Write again, wife. All who love Lillian are
anxious about her of course. It must be dreadful
to them to have her up here among her enemies!
This is the strangest war on record! Who ever
read of the families of the belligerents rushing
into the arms of their bitter foes for protection
and safety? Here is Mrs. Belmont, for instance,
who is shrinking and shivering at the very
thought of the contaminations of her son-in-law,
but who settles down as cozily as may be in the
very midst of those whom she would be glad to
see annihilated." He laughed heartily as he arose
from the table and left the house.</p>

<p>Their guest was irritated, excited and alarmed!
Had her daughter said more than had been imparted?
There was something in the manner of
both husband and wife that had made her feel this
was so. But what was it? O, if she could only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
get that letter! If her eyes could devour its contents!
She saw it go into the ample pocket of
the lady's dress and her mind was made up; she
would read it if in any way possible! She was
coming, that was sure, and he would be with her.
Could she meet them? How was it to be avoided?
She had told him without doubt; but what if she
had not? What if after all Lillian was anxious
to bury the past&mdash;what if she did not know? "It
was an error that I did not speak to her as she
stood beside the carriage that afternoon; but how
could I have explained? O the miseries of such
a life. O the wretchedness of wrong-doing! While
she is beloved, petted and sought after, I am suspected
and growled at by every churlish dog who
feels inclined to show his teeth menacingly! O
if there was a place on the broad earth where such
as I could find rest and concealment, thither would
I go! But that letter I must have! If, as I suspect,
a secret is divulged or a hint regarding my
reasons for being in Washington, then I will not
meet them, even if to avoid it I must hide myself
beneath the muddy waters of the Schuylkill. No!
no! Witness his exultations? Never!" It was
a firm conclusion, but the haughty mistress of
Rosedale never faltered when a resolve was fully
taken.</p>

<p>The next morning when Mrs. Cheevers was
superintending the kitchen, Mrs. Belmont might
have been seen standing before the door of that
lady's wardrobe, with a look of cynical scorn upon
her still handsome features as her keen eyes were
running over the page of the coveted letter she was
holding in her hand. "Ah! I thought so. Could
not tell what could have been my mission to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
Washington, but feared it was for no good, and
that justice might overtake me. Kind, certainly!
Yes, truly! The look on my face did 'reveal
much,'" and she turned the page. "Here was
where the 'exclamation points' came in. 'Revealed
much, and my prayer is'&mdash;bosh!&mdash;'that she
may be wise enough to run no risks. I have
learned that she passed herself off as an English
lady who had left the South on account of her
anti-war proclivities, and was admitted to the most
select circles on this account. If she is with you,
or shall come, detain her until'&mdash;O yes, she
could hear this. But why not the rest? The
truth is clear. I am suspected! What if that
splendid colonel of hers should take it into his
noble head to pay off a few of the old scores?" A
step was heard in the lower hall, and trusting the
letter into the lower pocket, from whence it had
been taken, she glided through an opposite door,
and returned to her own room.</p>

<p>"This is no place for me," she thought, as,
seating herself by the window, she prepared to
look at the whole matter as it now appeared. "I
am not wanted; but where can I go? Not to
Rosedale? That is utterly impossible. Not to
Charleston? There I shall be branded as a coward
and disloyal to the trust imposed in me. Where
can I go?" She sat a long time apparently
watching the pedestrians who were leisurely walking
past the house, and wondered if there was
another in that vast city more wretched, more
forlorn than was she. What a contrast to the
years that were gone! "And it has all come about
by the silliness of that girl. Her impudent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
foolish marriage has covered me with shame and
confusion." Ah, woman, not that!</p>

<p>"I'll do it!" she said at last. "How stupid in
me not to have thought of that before! It will be
dreary and desolate, but better so than to remain
here. Then the check for that last paltry five
hundred dollars must be cashed. A meager sum
for the mistress of Rosedale to go out into the
world with, but it will do." She arose from her
seat and crossed over to the mirror. "Not the
same face that was there&mdash;let me see&mdash;yes, seventeen
years ago. Then those lines were not at the
corners of the eyes, nor about the mouth; then
there was no silver in these dark locks, for no such
transgressions scorched my soul." She sank
down upon a chair close by, and buried her face in
her jeweled hands, and for the first time for many
months tears came to moisten the hard ground
where the roots of womanly affection were buried.</p>

<p>"My child! O, my child!" she murmured at
last, as her long taper fingers were clasping themselves
tightly together. "I have wronged you.
It was cruel, fiendish, to take your babe from you;
but doubly so&mdash;wretch that I am!&mdash;to plot her
ruin by sending her off to a foreign port, where I
thought she could never return. What a curse
has fallen upon me! I did not intend all that was
done. Those terrible black stains cannot be upon
my soul."</p>

<p>The autumnal winds came and blew gently over
the great city, scattering upon the tree-tops and
velvety carpets of its many parks and lawns their
tracery of change. The birds gathered themselves
together among the branches to finish their
arrangements for the long journey. Yet Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
Belmont lingered in her pleasant quarters, loth to
exchange them for less comfortable ones. Then
letters of inquiry, letters of solicitation, had been
written, and answers must be waited for&mdash;and so
she stayed.</p>

<p>All this time the two colonels were slowly but
positively improving. George St. Clair might
endure the jar and fatigue of travel, and Pearl
Hamilton his former position at the head of his
regiment, and word was sent to their respective
destinations to this effect.</p>

<p>"In a week Pearl and Lillian will be here," was
the report brought by Mrs. Cheevers on returning
one day from a short round of calls, and her air
was a trifle exultant. "We must do them honor,
Mr. Cheevers. A colonel who has suffered and
bled for our good, and to maintain the dignity of a
free government, deserves all the glory an appreciative
people can bestow."</p>

<p>The husband straightened himself back in his
chair, and indulged in a most mirthful "encore."
"Bravo, wife! The war is making personal developments
as well. Who ever imagined there was
so much of the truly eloquent in the bosom of my
sweet little half? And such patriotism!"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! All of that fine speech, I tell you,
came from the brain where such evolutions of respect
for the brave boys are expected to be in
action. We must give honor where honor is due."</p>

<p>"True as you live, wife; and now what is to be
done?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Charlotte can suggest, for if our
fraternal strife has not awakened as much <i>patriotism</i>
in her heart as in yours, in the present case
her <i>interest</i> should be greater."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>The lady thus appealed to was listening with
more interest than her companions were aware
of, but the queries that were perplexing her were
not how she could bestow honors upon the worthy,
but how she, the unworthy, could escape
dishonor! "I cannot stay longer," she thought;
"I must away!" At being thus appealed to,
however, she replied blandly; "I have waited
weeks already that I might bestow my congratulations,
but, as they have delayed coming so long,
have made other arrangements that will be impossible
to postpone. I have been loitering that
letters from home might reach me, and cannot
understand why Charles does not write. In a day
or two, at the farthest, I shall be compelled to
leave for my winter quarters."</p>

<p>"Leave here!" exclaimed Mrs. Cheevers, with
surprise.</p>

<p>"Certainly. You did not suppose I was to impose
myself on my friends as a settled fact, did
you?" She smiled, but it was only as a feeble ray
struggling across the chill, damp cloud, where the
winter's snows were gathering.</p>

<p>"But it will look strangely, and I beg your
pardon, one might think a trifle suspicious; it
may be a fear lest you should meet them. I do
not say that I think so, but such things might
be said!"</p>

<p>"A new development, my dear! Is it prescience
or imagination that is now whirling in your
prolific brain?"</p>

<p>"Do not jest, Hiram; really there is a seriousness
in all this. Why could you not have been
a good staid old Quaker, like your father, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
you could have been sensible when circumstances
seemed to demand it?"</p>

<p>"Hardly, according to nature, wife, to be old,
like my honored sire, as our birthdays did not
come in the same year."</p>

<p>This little humorous parley gave their guest
ample time to recover from her shock of indignation
and alarm. How was this to end? Would
her departure excite suspicion? But it was
known here, without doubt,&mdash;a part, if not the
whole truth&mdash;for letters had been received from
Washington into which she had not been permitted
to have a peep. Lillian knew where her
mother had taken refuge, and, probably, was expecting
to meet her.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" darted up through her accumulating
perplexities, and burst from her quivering
lips.</p>

<p>"Do? Why stay where you are, and welcome
your child as a mother should, greet her husband
cordially and sensibly. It must be done, and what
have you to fear? Are you a criminal fleeing
from justice and dare not come in contact with
honest people? You need not look at me so,
certainly if you abscond on the very eve of their
arrival these are the only conclusions that can
be adduced. Is it not so husband?"</p>

<p>"Face the music, Charlotte; face the music!
If your native zeal has carried you outside the
track, switch on again, and go ahead. But here
I am wasting my precious time listening to two
silly women, and on an empty stomach at that!
Charlotte, why did you not bring along one of
your ebony faithfuls? I am getting tired of waiting
three times a day for my meals."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>"Irene is slow, but I ought to have attended to
my duties better. The fact is, I am getting out of
house-keeping and gone into the business of minding
other people's affairs," and the good lady
walked out of the room.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Cheevers is right on this subject; you
cannot leave here at this time without drawing censure
and, it may be, suspicion down upon yourself.
I would not do it."</p>

<p>Supper was announced, and Mrs. Belmont,
trembling with emotion, as her pride went on battling
with fear and indignation, seated herself at
the table, but not to eat. There was a vein of proffered
wisdom in the advice given that irritated her.
"Can I not judge for myself? Am I not supposed
to know more about my own business than
others."</p>

<p>Mr. Cheevers rallied her upon such a loss of appetite
and the saving it would be to his pocket, a
pleasantry in which the lady endeavored to join,
but the <i>repartee</i> died on her lips, and, excusing
herself, she went without farther delay to her
own room.</p>

<p>"That woman, wife, has her own reasons for
desiring to escape doing honor to Colonel Hamilton
and lady, that we are not advised of. As for
me, I begin to pity her! She looks as though
she had lost her hold on earth and her hope of
heaven!"</p>

<p>"How can you, Hiram."</p>

<p>"It is true. Perhaps Lillian ought to have
written to her mother, and yet, as she declared,
what could she say? It is a muddle, my good
wife, sure enough, still we must keep her here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
until they come. That is the only clear thing I
can get out of it," and he left the table.</p>

<p>In the room above, a tall, stately form was
standing by the window, her dark eyes wandering
with a listless gaze out over the gray waters
of the Schuylkill, where the evening shades were
slowly creeping, while within her soul the conflicting
elements of warring tumults were raging.
"O, wretched woman that I am!" she repeated,
"What power can deliver me from myself! Great
God! If Thou didst ever pity, pity now! Are
there not stains on my soul that He will never
blot out? Stains of&mdash;murder! O misery! 'The
wicked shall not go unpunished,'&mdash;I have read
it; it is true! The God I have offended has said
it! What if the curtain that hides the last seventeen
years from the world should be torn away!"
She paced the floor as the night stole in and covered
her with its darkness. O, the gloom! O, the
forebodings of a sin-cursed soul.</p>

<h3><a name="LIGHT_THROUGH_THE_RIFTED_CLOUD" id="LIGHT_THROUGH_THE_RIFTED_CLOUD"></a>LIGHT THROUGH THE RIFTED CLOUD.</h3>


<p>"She's gone, as true as you live! The carriage
was at the door for herself and baggage before I
knew a word about it."</p>

<p>With these exclamations, Mrs. Cheevers met her
husband the day after the events of our last
chapter. He had come to dinner with the cheering
news that there was to be an ovation given to
Colonel Hamilton at the Girard House on his
arrival, but found his wife too much excited to
appreciate the honors thus to be conferred on her
pet.</p>

<p>"That looks squally. Perhaps she has good
reasons for skulking, but it does not look to me
like her original shrewdness. It would have been
more natural to see her stand by and fight it out.
But let her go; there is more room for the new-comers."</p>

<p>The matter being thus disposed of, quiet was
again wooed to the peaceful home of the good uncle
and aunt, who had nothing to do now but to anticipate
coming pleasures. Colonel St. Clair was to
remain with them also for a short rest, before
finishing his journey up the Hudson.</p>

<p>"Lillian has told me so much about him that he
will not seem like a stranger."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lillian's lovers are our friends, my good wife;
so he will come in for a share of attention."</p>

<p>The hour came when a carriage containing the
happy trio rolled up to the door of Mrs. Cheevers'
very inviting home on Race street, where Mrs.
Cheevers unceremoniously rushed out with open
arms to greet them. The host was not far behind.
When the first joyous greetings had partially
subsided, he took Colonel St. Clair under his kind
protection, and helped him gently to an easy chair
in the warm, cheerful parlor.</p>

<p>"You will excuse me," called out Colonel Hamilton,
as he stepped back into the carriage; "there
is a little woman down on Twentieth street who
wants a kiss from her soldier boy. I'll be back in
time for that roast beef!" And the carriage turned
the corner and was out of sight.</p>

<p>"Well, that is cool! But, wife, we are not so
smart as we take ourselves to be. Why did we not
have that mother who wants to be kissed up here,
so that it could all be done at once? It is terrible
to have such things dragging."</p>

<p>"I did ask her and insisted, but she said 'No'
every time. 'Pearl will come right here,' she
declared, 'and it is in his own home where I want
to give him welcome.'"</p>

<p>"Noble woman!" interposed St. Clair from his
chair by the grate.</p>

<p>"You say she is gone?" asked Mrs. Hamilton
in her aunt's dressing room, where she had been
escorted by the hostess herself.</p>

<p>"We tried hard to have her remain, but no
amount of persuasion could accomplish it. She is
dreadfully troubled about something. I attempted
to draw her out, but you know how difficult such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
a thing would be. And, having watched her
manner and face, I do believe that something
weighs heavily on her mind."</p>

<p>"She need not have flown from me. My
mother's reputation is sacred to her daughter. She
should have known this. And you have no idea
where she has gone?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. She said she had been waiting
for letters before going to her winter quarters,
and was surprised that she received nothing from
Charles."</p>

<p>"It is too bad! But, Auntie, I have much I
want to pour into your dear heart, for somehow I
feel that in stirring up its pure waters, I may step
in and, perhaps, be healed a little!" and she kissed
the smiling face. "What should I do without
you? But I fear the gentlemen though will think
we have deserted them."</p>

<p>There was so much to be said; so much calling
to be done, and such a large circle of friends to
receive, that it was not until the third day, when
the dinner was being given at the Girard in
honor of the wounded soldier (to which Colonel
St. Clair had been officially invited), that Mrs.
Cheevers and Lillian found an opportunity for the
"stirring of the waters."</p>

<p>"Do not let me frighten you, Auntie; and may
the dear Father keep me from injustice and
wrong! How shall I tell you? There is no use
in trying to smooth it over; I do believe that up
to six months ago my child lived!"</p>

<p>"Lillian!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do believe it! George St. Clair, and
the whole family saw her! She was just sixteen,
and had the same eyes and ways that I have!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
It was remarked by all, and my mother, at times,
betrayed an unusual degree of interest in her."</p>

<p>"Where was this?"</p>

<p>"In Savannah. She was the adopted daughter
of a Mrs. Gaylord, who was visiting friends in
that city, and farther down in the country. I did
want to see my mother so much! A dark suspicion
oppresses me!"</p>

<p>"Lillian!"</p>

<p>"I cannot help it; and you will not blame me
when I have told you all! My mother took that
child into a carriage, with only one servant, a
dastardly coward, and drove one evening down the
river, in sight of the beach; then, getting her to
alight, that (as she said), a better view of the
sea might be obtained, the child was kidnapped in
the darkness and borne away; and with every
effort that could be made, no trace has ever been
found of her! O, Auntie, <i>that was my child</i>!
Will God permit such a deed to remain uncovered?
Will not his anger search it out?"</p>

<p>"But, my dear Lillian, you must have greater
proof than this before you so grievously accuse
another! There is some mistake; she <i>could</i> not
have done such a deed! Why not write to Mrs.
Gaylord and learn where she found the child,
and all that she knows about her?"</p>

<p>"I did, Auntie, but was answered by her husband,
who said that his wife had very unexpectedly
taken it into her head to go north while
he was away, and could not say when she would
return, etc. Now where that 'north' is, cannot
be ascertained, as he was to immediately return
to his post, in the army, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Have you told Pearl?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I cannot. If Mother had remained here,
it may be that she could have cleared away the
cloud, but how can I breathe this most humiliating
suspicion into his ear? He knows of her
transaction in regard to our separation, and was
magnanimous enough to bury it; but it would be
agony to tell him more. He does not know of
that heart-breaking curse, that would be almost
unendurable, were it not for the great joy that has
come to me. But, Auntie; what do you think?
Was Lily Gaylord my child? My Lily-Pearl?"
Her large eyes were fixed with a burning gaze
on the troubled face before her.</p>

<p>"Your child, Lillian? I do not wonder at your
earnestness! yet I cannot tell you; but confide in
Pearl, he will know better how to counsel."</p>

<p>"I cannot! This work I must do myself!
But one thing is certain; my heart shall be satisfied!
If alive she is mine; if dead I must know
it! This poisonous canker-worm has been for
years gnawing at my very soul! My convictions
have been, and still are, that there was a grievous
wrong done me when I was told that she had been
transplanted to a purer clime! It was not death
that stole her from me!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Where was the subject of all this anxiety and
solicitude on this calm, hazy October day? In
Boston; as happy and peaceful as a young girl of
sixteen ever desired to be.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaylord had received letters from her husband
saying that he was glad she had taken it
into her silly head to go north, and it was his
opinion she might better remain until the immediate
danger that was threatening Western Virginia had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
passed. His brother's widow, with her children,
could take care of "Birch Wood." Acting upon
these suggestions she had returned to Boston and
hired a suite of rooms, and, taking Willie with
them, was ensconced amid all desired comforts and
luxuries. Tiny was entrusted with extraordinary
responsibilities and her yellow face grew brighter
when enstalled as mistress of the kitchen, while Lily
superintended the whole establishment. Willie
was exuberant and Mrs. Gaylord peaceful. Rover
had at all times his full share of attention, and his
bed by the kitchen stove was soft and warm.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft often called, with their
sunny faces, during the long winter months, but
Mrs. Gaylord seldom left her warm rooms.</p>

<p>"Here we will stay until the war is over," said
that lady one evening as they gathered around the
table preparatory to an hour of reading and listening.
The wind roared threateningly up from the
"Bay" and the snow beat outside against the windows,
but within that comfortable home reigned
peace and love. Lily was again by the great sea,
and, when she sat at her chamber window and
looked over the dark waters and watched the rolling
waves as they dashed upon the piers in
the harbor, the old days came back to her;
the dreams of her childhood; the longings of her
restless heart while she thought of the beautiful
lady who had picked her up from the billows; of
the pearls deep down in the waters, where she had
grown, and called her "Lily Pearl." Should she
ever know how she had come by that name? She
was "Lily Gaylord" now; the Phebe of other days
had been put aside among the disagreeables of the
past; except with Willie, who declared that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
must ever be his own precious Phebe, or the brightness
would be all taken out of the sunny memories;
and she had answered "call me what you will,
my brother, only let me live in your heart and
thoughts:" and so the days went on.</p>

<h3><a name="A_STORM_ABOUT_THE_WIDOWS_COTTAGE" id="A_STORM_ABOUT_THE_WIDOWS_COTTAGE"></a>A STORM ABOUT THE WIDOW'S COTTAGE.</h3>


<p>It was a damp and chilly morning when George
St. Clair left the home of the Cheevers. A shadow
of pain had settled down upon the handsome face
of the heroic officer, and as Pearl Hamilton saw it
he exclaimed with all the fervor of the brotherly
love which had grown up between them: "You
shall not go alone, even to New York, for you look
as disconsolate as a rejected lover; and what if
your father should miss you in that terrific hub-bub?
I can get back to-night, so please excuse
me to my mother at dinner, Lillian;" and snatching
his hat and coat from the rack he took the arm
of his companion and went with him down the
marble steps.</p>

<p>"Please, George," called out Lillian from the
door; "do not let Pearl get lost by the way. My
heart tells me to throw the old shoe of good luck
after you, with the wish that your visit at the
North may be as productive of joy as was mine
nearly eighteen years ago, without any of its
shadows!" It was a bright face that now beamed
from the carriage, and as St. Clair waved his hand
to the ladies it rolled rapidly away.</p>

<p>"I am glad after all that he was not obliged to
go alone," remarked Mrs. Cheevers as they turned
to enter the house. "I am fearful his poor back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
will never be strong again! In my opinion his
days of fighting are over."</p>

<p>"I wish those days were ended for all," said
Lillian, thoughtfully. "The papers bring us sad
records of late. So many precious lives lost; so
many loving hearts desolated! I liked Dr. Wadsworth's
sermon yesterday morning from the text
'show thyself a man,' but I could but think that
David meant in his living rather than in his dying!
It may be noble in one to lay down his life
for the preservation of his country's honor, but
love is as surely bereft after all!"</p>

<p>They were seated now by the warm grate where
the red coals were piled up in a cheerful glow, and
while the aunt took some work from the basket on
the table her companion gazed pensively into them.
At last turning quickly around, while a smile
lighted up her face she remarked: "I am dizzy!
I am reminded so often of our little trick of 'whirling'
in childhood, until, unable to stand we would
drop down on the green grass and wait for the
sensation of giddiness to pass off. But what is to
be done, Auntie, when the whirling never ceases?"</p>

<p>"Fall down upon the grass my child and wait,
but be sure that in the falling you gain the power
to wait!"</p>

<p>"True, Aunt; and yet how like Peter we are
prone to look about us while walking over the
waves, until our faith gives way and we begin to
sink!"</p>

<p>"And what did Peter do? Sit down on the first
billow he met and declare 'he was dizzy' and perplexed?"</p>

<p>Lillian laughed. "Not much like Peter am I
after all?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>While this conversation was going on in the little
parlor the two colonels were crossing the Delaware,
and were soon in the cars rolling rapidly
towards the great metropolis.</p>

<p>"But, Colonel Hamilton, you must confess that
it was not pleasant while receiving the sympathies
and kindnesses of the people, to remember I
was wounded in the army that would, if they
could, annihilate yours."</p>

<p>"But they cannot!"</p>

<p>"That does not take away my chagrin! Here I
am in the midst of those whom I once hoped, it
may be, to conquer or slay, and from their hands
receiving the 'coals of fire' that are scorching my
heart instead of my head. It is this that makes
me wish to bury myself away from it all."</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow; you are not the only one
who ever changed his convictions! Just make
yourself comfortable! See how rapidly we are
getting along! Here is Burlington. I wish there
were a boat going up the river as soon as you arrive
in the city, so that you could lie down the
rest of the way."</p>

<p>"I am getting so 'yankeeized' that I could
never wait for the slow motion of a steamer. I
must take the lightning express."</p>

<p>"And be at your destination before tea-time?"</p>

<p>"So Ellen has written me."</p>

<p>"Well, take good care of your heart. This
mixing up of fractions makes very serious troubles
sometimes."</p>

<p>"But in the final union of whole numbers there
is bliss! Why not work out the sum and hand
over the product in your advice?" A merry laugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
followed this query, while the long train whirled
on.</p>

<p>There was a happy reunion in the widow's cottage
when Mr. St. Clair returned with his son to
occupy the easy chair that had been especially
procured for him. The mother had not seen him
since the time when in his rebel uniform he had
bid her good-bye in the far-away home, and her
eyes were swimming with tears as she looked upon
his changed face.</p>

<p>"They did not tell me you were so thin and
pale," she said as she kissed him tenderly.</p>

<p>"But I am very weary now; you have no idea
what a night's rest will do for my good looks."
Still the mother's heart beat with a low, sad throbbing.</p>

<p>Anna was placid and reserved. Her greetings
were cordial, while none save the maternal eye
peered beneath the external calm.</p>

<p>"Well this is cozy," he remarked, as the two
young ladies drew his chair close to the table.
"Still it is a little mortifying to my masculine
dignity&mdash;this being waited upon by ladies instead
of slaves!"</p>

<p>"It is the way with us up here," replied the sister;
"and all you can possibly do is to submit
with as much grace as you can muster for the purpose.
Where is Toby?" she continued, as though
missing him for the first time.</p>

<p>"Taking good care of his liberty. I have not
seen him since he concluded to use his privileges
as a free man."</p>

<p>The days sped rapidly by. The cool winds
came sweeping up from the broad Hudson, while
the frosts painted the trees with gaudy tints,
blighting the flowers and searing the green grass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are we not imposing upon good nature?" the
son asked one morning, as, leaning on the arm of
his father, they walked out among the fallen
leaves that were carpeting the smoothly shorn
lawn. "It seems to me we must be burdensome.
Why do we not go to our rooms at the hotel?"</p>

<p>"Are you not more comfortable here? Mrs.
Pierson is so kind, and we have all become so fully
domesticated at a home fireside that it would be a
sad change to take up our quarters at the public
inn."</p>

<p>"But Ellen wrote&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;'that she had secured rooms at
Maple Grove,' which, after all, meant here under
these maple trees. But if you desire it, my son&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not the only one to be considered. It
seems that the mother and daughter have altogether
too much work to do, with only one servant in the
kitchen, and she a white girl."</p>

<p>The father laughed. "You have no idea how
easily they perform their labor. Even the servant
sings as cheerfully as though she was mistress of
all, and indeed it would be hard to tell who fills
that important position in this home. But I will
do just as you and Ellen shall decide."</p>

<p>They had reached the door, and were entering
as the last sentence was being finished.</p>

<p>"Decide what?" interrogated Ellen.</p>

<p>"About those rooms at the hotel;" laughed the
father.</p>

<p>"They will remain <i>in statu quo</i> as long as they
are paid for, will they not? As for me, I am in
no hurry to leave my present quarters. My
diploma is not yet secured in bread and pie making,
and it would be unmanly in you to be the means of
crushing my ambition."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it my duty to nip in the bud any attempt
at conspiracy. So while you all remain here
in this pleasant sitting room, I will go into the
parlor with my easy chair. Will you, my sister,
invite Miss Anna to join me there? Unless your
influence has diluted her frankness, she will reveal
the whole matter. At any rate, this must be
settled."</p>

<p>"A capital suggestion! Anna shall be judge,
jury and all, and we poor subjects will cheerfully
abide by her decision." And Ellen darted away
after the young lady in question.</p>

<p>"For shame, to put me in such a dilemma!"
exclaimed Anna, as she placed the flakey crust she
was preparing on the pie tin; but the crimson
wave that rolled over neck, cheek and brow did not
escape the notice of her companion.</p>

<p>"O, you need not appear so much shocked at the
thought of meeting him, for he will not make love
to you. Never fear! The little foot of Lillian
Belmont crushed all the romance out of his heart a
long time ago. So, away; I can finish that pie
while Rhoda is making the pudding."</p>

<p>Anna obeyed without a word, and we will let her
enter alone that quiet, pretty parlor where the
wounded soldier was waiting.</p>

<p>"Two hours as I live!" exclaimed Ellen, as the
clock on the mantel struck twelve.</p>

<p>"It takes time to settle long accounts," replied
the mother, quaintly.</p>

<p>"He is determined to go, I reckon;" interposed
the father, cheerily; but Mrs. Pierson was silent.</p>

<p>"Dinner is all ready, and I am just as hungry!
Can't I go and see how the matter stands?" This
question was addressed to the widow, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
sitting by the window, looking out on the seared
and fading grass.</p>

<p>There was a sad expression about the mouth,
and a tremor in the voice not usually there, as she
answered: "Yes, dear; Rhoda does not like to
wait without a cause."</p>

<p>Amid laughing and jesting, the easy chair was
drawn out, still containing its occupant, while
Anna disappeared through an opposite door, and
was not seen until the family had gathered around
the well-filled table.</p>

<p>"Well, how is it, my boy?" queried Mr. St.
Clair. "How about Maple Grove Inn? Are we
to leave such delicacies as these for others
untried?"</p>

<p>"Anna is chairman of that committee, and is to
hand over the report," replied George.</p>

<p>There was an expression on the face of the
young lady thus appealed to that caused Ellen St.
Clair to look quickly towards her brother, who met
her wondering gaze with a comical smile very significant
in itself, and made the sister exclaim: "I
should think both of you are 'chairmen,' if one was
to judge from the amount of knowledge that seems
lurking in your eyes. Out with it! What is the
report?"</p>

<p>"Patience is one of the cardinal virtues, my
dear," suggested the father, gravely. "Such an
extended consultation requires much thought in
the summing up."</p>

<p>"I conclude by Miss Anna's silence that the
pleasing office of 'reporter' is conferred upon her
unworthy servant; therefore listen to the 'summing
up;'" and laying down his fork, with folded
arms, George St. Clair leaned back in his easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
chair. "The question propounded, with its prelude,
was something after this sort: I said, My
dear girl, when I was well and strong I gave into
your love and tender watchful care my two honored
parents and one pretty little sister, and most faithfully
have you regarded my trust; and now a
fourth comes creeping and hobbling into your
paradise of peace and comfort, and although he
has nothing to recommend him, would pray to be
admitted, not to your care, but to your heart and
enduring love. Will you as cheerfully grant my
petition in this, as in the former instance? And
her reply, after brushing away a few of the cobwebs
of the past, was 'I will, with the permission
of my mother, who has a right to be consulted
upon all such articles of transfer.'"</p>

<p>"I do declare!" burst from the lips of the sister.
"The great subject of remaining as honorary
members of this most hospitable family, I believe,
was not broached by the committee."</p>

<p>"As to myself," interposed the father, "I am
very naturally inclined, after placing in the hands
of our hostess a sufficient sum for every expense,
including the perplexities such an increase of
family would cause, to remain in our present quarters
until further developments."</p>

<p>"Very likely!" interposed the mother with
with a beaming face.</p>

<p>Anna had left her seat at the head of the table
at the very commencement of this little speech,
and the hostess sat with folded hands pale and
trembling as one in a troubled dream. Mr. and
Mrs. St. Clair looked at each other with surprise
written all over their good-natured faces, but the
sister was lost in amazement. She had not once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
thought such a union possible, and was not ready
to give it sanction.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pierson, tell me frankly, do you wish
that the bullet which so ignobly tore my back had
finished its work, so that the present summing up
would have been avoided? It would not, however,
have saved your daughter's heart, for she loved
me before all that."</p>

<p>The widow looked calmly into the face of the
speaker as she answered tremulously: "My
daughter's happiness is my highest ambition. Not
so much as to the comforts of this life as to the
assurances of the life to come. Wealth or honorable
position socially have not been included in
my aspirations for her. Congenial companionship
and a true heart are the highest blessings of life I
could wish." Tears came into her eyes and she
arose from the table to hide them.</p>

<p>"I am not going to let my dinner spoil at any
rate!" exclaimed Mr. St. Clair, with a composing
laugh: "This roast lamb is capital."</p>

<p>"And you would like some coffee;" suggested
Anna, appearing at her post, while Mrs. Pierson
returned to her seat at the table.</p>

<p>"Now that is sensible. Let us appoint an hour
for congratulations and proceed with present duties
unmolested. George, my boy, replenish the
stomach if you would restore the back. For my
part I think this a most capital arrangement.
With the old homestead, 'West Lawn' and 'Rosedale,'
which I shall be obliged to take into my
possession, will yield us all what bread and butter
we shall require&mdash;not as good as this perhaps, but
it will do. By the way, I would like to know
where Mrs. Belmont is."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gone back to Rosedale!" suggested Mrs. St.
Clair with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! If she could indulge in such
an unwomanly sneak as to fly from the presence
of her daughter, she would never risk her neck
down among the bullets that are whizzing so near
her home. No&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>He rattled on as a merry accompaniment to the
monotonous sounds of knife and fork; but the responses
were few and subdued. A hush had fallen
upon more than one heart in that little circle
around the well-filled board, yet to none was it
dark or gloomy. There were sunbeams streaming
through bright golden tints lighting them up, but
Ellen St. Clair did not raise her eyes. She loved
Anna, but had not thought of her as the bride of
her peerless brother. "And what would Bertha
say?" It was so unexpected!</p>

<p>So intent were they with their own thoughts
that no notice had been given to the dark cloud
that had suddenly risen up from the south, spreading
itself over the sky, until a fearful gust of wind
dashed against the windows and made all start to
their feet in alarm.</p>

<p>"A regular southern hurricane," remarked
Mrs. St. Clair. "See how those trees bend and
what a shower of bright leaves are in the air."</p>

<p>The rain dashed against the panes, while the
gale blew the clouds at a rapid speed northward,
stripping the branches of their gaudy dress and
strewing the faded grass with a carpet of gay
colors. George St. Clair watched it with mingled
emotions. It was noonday, yet the darkness was
oppressive. He saw the dense cloud sweep over
the sun, leaving in its trail the hazy blue of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
autumn sky. He listened to the fitful wail of the
angry blast and thought of the tornado that was
at that moment devastating the beautiful fields
and groves of his sunny land, and the spirit of rebellion
arose in his heart. "What was the need
of this noonday storm? Why must war rifle the
land of its beauty and crimson the earth with the
shed blood of thousands?"</p>

<h3><a name="A_PROUD_SPIRIT_BROKEN" id="A_PROUD_SPIRIT_BROKEN"></a>A PROUD SPIRIT BROKEN.</h3>


<p>Only a week and Colonel Hamilton was ordered
back to Washington. The right wing of the army
was to swing round over West Virginia, to intercept,
if possible, the progressive movements of
General Lee's forces that were threatening a northern
aggression; and every officer able for action
was ordered to report at headquarters. Lillian would
not remain behind. How could she fold her hands
and wait? She must work; her mind must be
employed or the dizzy whirl would overpower her.
Besides, she had a mission, of which all others,
unless it was her Aunt Cheevers, were ignorant.
The plan of operation had been secretly marked
out by herself, and she must go.</p>

<p>"I can never let that Mason and Dixon line
divide us again," was her closing remark after
listening to a long list of reasons why she should
remain in her comfortable surroundings amid
friends and luxuries.</p>

<p>The fond husband could not refuse, and together
they entered the National Capital, and were greeted
cordially by sympathizers and army officials.
As, however, we are not writing the history of the
rebellion, but only narrating incidents gathered
during its progress, we will not trace the march of
Colonel Hamilton's corps, but will meet him again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
when the warm days return to deck the blood-stained
land with beauty and breathe freshness
once more into the trampled vegetation.</p>

<p>There had been skirmishes along the line of
march, fightings, repulses and victories; and Lillian
had not been permitted to fold her hands.
There were the sick to be attended to, and wounded
to be dressed; while the 'cup of cold water'
and the 'oil and wine' were needed everywhere:
Whether friend or foe; Confederate or Unionist, it
made no difference, in each she discovered a brother,
and withheld no comfort or ministration in
her power.</p>

<p>"You seem young to be in the army," she said
one day to a beardless youth who had been
severely wounded by a sharpshooter and was
placed under her care.</p>

<p>"Eighteen, ma'am," was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me your name?" she asked,
while tenderly bathing the pale face and combing
the rich brown hair from a full rounded forehead.</p>

<p>"Rufus Gaylord."</p>

<p>She started.</p>

<p>"Gaylord!"</p>

<p>How her thoughts flew! What a sweep over
they took in that intervening moment of silence!</p>

<p>"Is your father's name Hudson Gaylord?"</p>

<p>"No; he is my uncle. Do you know him? I
thought you were a Northerner!"</p>

<p>"I know him only by reputation. Where is
he?"</p>

<p>"Down in Richmond, <i>talking</i> about arming the
niggers, I reckon;" was his answer, while a
sneer curled his lip. "Beechwood is only a few
miles from here and I want to be taken back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
to it as soon as I can ride so far, as Mother does
not know where I am."</p>

<p>Here was an opening to the cloud; should she
enter it? How she trembled at the thought.</p>

<p>"Is your aunt at Beechwood?" she found
breath to inquire at last.</p>

<p>"No, she is in Boston, and Uncle Hud says will
stay there until the army leaves Virginia. I don't
reckon she cares how long she stays though, for
she has her girl back again, every one thought
was drowned, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Her adopted daughter! did you say?"</p>

<p>"Well, y-e-s! But what do you know about
her? I'll be hanged if I shouldn't think you
were her sister; I never saw eyes more alike.
She is splendid, and I am glad she has come to
life again;" and in spite of a deep wound in the
shoulder, and the presence of a bullet somewhere
in the chest, his cheek flushed with boyish admiration
as he talked of his foster cousin, and Lillian
did not fail to discover the cause of the deepening
blush.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of what you have been saying?"</p>

<p>"Sure that Aunt Nell is in Boston, and that she
has Lily with her; but not quite sure as to you
being her sister." In spite of her emotion, Mrs.
Hamilton smiled at the ingenuity of this remark.
Her resolution was taken. She would return to
Washington, and, as soon as possible, go to Boston,
and find this girl who bore such a striking resemblance
to herself. She arose to answer a call
and found that her trembling limbs refused to do
her bidding. As she reseated herself the boy said
kindly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon you are not feeling very well. I
would rest a bit, for it must be dreadful taking care
of such a lot!"</p>

<p>True to her purpose, within a week she had
communicated with Colonel Hamilton and obtained
a leave of absence, and was on her way to Philadelphia.
A little breathing spell was necessary; she
would stop and tell auntie all about it!</p>

<p>It was night when she reached the city, and,
taking a carriage, she was soon in Race street.
Stopping at the corner, she had a fancy to go alone
to look in upon the peaceful home-scene, if perchance
the curtain was left up at the side window.
Was auntie thinking of her? She would give her
a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>How little we know what is to fill the next
moment that sweeps through our eventful lives!
The curtain was left up, as she had imagined,
and sitting by the table in the center of the room
were two ladies, instead of the one she had expected
to find alone. The gas shone directly upon
the face of Mrs. Cheevers, but the head of the
other was turned away. Still there was no mistaking
that imperious posture and stateliness of
form, or the braids of jetty hair. It was her
mother! They were talking, but she could not
distinguish a word. What caused that guilty
mother to move so uneasily in her chair, and
turn towards the spot where her daughter stood
trembling in the shadows? Had conscience
touched a note of warning?</p>

<p>"I must enter," thought Lillian, and passing
around to the front door, rang the bell. Mrs.
Cheevers answered it in person. "Do not speak,
Auntie; it is I," she said, hurriedly, as the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
opened. "My mother is in there; I saw her
through the window. How shall I meet her?"</p>

<p>"Promptly and boldly, my child. Come right
in."</p>

<p>She led the way, while her visitor followed
trembling in every limb. "What has brought
you back at this time?" she went on cheerfully to
ask. "You said nothing about it in your last
letter." Mrs. Belmont arose as they approached,
and stood pale and haggard before her injured
child.</p>

<p>"My mother!" Lillian exclaimed, with outstretched
arms. "How I have wanted to meet
you! Why did you flee from me?"</p>

<p>"You wanted to see me? Lillian, is that
true?"</p>

<p>"It is true, Mother. Why do you look so
sternly? Has your daughter committed the unpardonable
sin because she felt disposed to forsake
all others, if need be, and cleave to her husband?"</p>

<p>"Well, do you understand it? See where I now
am! Look at the shame, the disgrace, the poverty,
you have brought upon me! I am a wanderer
without home or country, a pauper in a strange
land, and you have done it. Once I would have
died for you; but what have you sacrificed for
me?" She turned slowly and reseated herself by
the table.</p>

<p>"This is my mother! Cold, stern and unloving!"
And sinking down upon the sofa her
pent-up feelings found vent in tears.</p>

<p>"It is my opinion, Charlotte," said Mrs.
Cheevers, calmly, "that the day will come when
you will repent the injustice of this hour. If all
you have said is true in regard to yourself, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
can you afford to throw away so wantonly a
daughter's proffered affection? If she can overlook
the wrongs of her mother, that mother ought
to clasp her tightly in the arms of love."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mrs. Cheevers? What
have I done to her that should call forth such a
remark from a third party?"</p>

<p>"O, you need not take the trouble to tell me to
mind my own business; for whatever affects my
brother's wife or his child is my affair; and I repeat,
it is your duty to lay aside that stately indignation,
and if Lillian will extend the hand of
filial love, it is yours to clasp it."</p>

<p>Mr. Cheevers coming home from the store,
turned the current of conversation into another
channel.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" he exclaimed, as he recognized
the bowed figure on the sofa. "Mrs. Hamilton, as
I live! Just put down that little white hand and
kiss your old uncle. Just as glad to see you as
though you were my own daughter. How is
Pearl? Now, look here, Lillian," he continued, as
he perceived the quivering lips attempting to
answer; "none of that toward me! Anybody who
draws the moisture out of those beautiful eyes
while I am around must answer for the offence.
There isn't another in this great city to-night who
has more reason to laugh and be glad than have
you, so be about it! Let that statue of dignity
mump it out if she is determined to do so, but the
wife of Colonel Hamilton has no good reason for
tears."</p>

<p>"Hiram!" interposed the wife, and she shook
her head menacingly at him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is all very well; but what brought you to
us so unexpectedly?"</p>

<p>"A little business, Uncle," Lillian replied, finding
voice to speak. "I am going farther north,
perhaps to Boston, and shall return here when my
object is accomplished."</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmont turned hastily in her chair, and
glared at the speaker with dilated eye balls.</p>

<p>"To Boston!" cried Mr. Cheevers. "Well, now
if I were a woman I would ask 'What under the
sun are you going there for?'"</p>

<p>"But as you are a gentleman you will wait
patiently until I can tell you all."</p>

<p>"Just so. Did you come on the eight train?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you thought, wife, of food and rest?"</p>

<p>"Stupid as ever! I will go immediately."</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmont soon followed the lady out of the
room. An hour afterward, while sitting at the
table, where a bountiful lunch had been prepared,
Mrs. Cheevers told Lillian that her mother had retired
to her room feeling very unwell.</p>

<p>"Probably!" retorted her husband, with a merry
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"That is not fair Hiram; she has been sick
ever since she returned; and I think she was fearful
of an approaching illness or she would not
have come here. I went with her to-day to see
Dr. Kehn about her head, and it was his opinion
that there was some trouble with the brain that
might prove serious, and you know that you have
spoken of the wild look in her eyes."</p>

<p>"And have not wondered at it, wife; but you
are looking well, Lillian, field life agrees with you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>"</p>

<p>"Tired though, and have come to Uncle Hiram's
for a little rest."</p>

<p>"That's right, my child. I only wish you could
have brought Pearl along."</p>

<p>There was a long talk in an upper room that
night not far from the guest-chamber to which
Mrs. Belmont had retired; for Lillian had desired
to tell her aunt all about it, and the good lady
listened and wondered.</p>

<p>"Boston is a great city, my child, and what if
you could not find Mrs. Gaylord?"</p>

<p>"Her husband mentioned in his letter the name
of a Mr. Bancroft, merchant I believe, and through
him I thought to learn all I desired. At any rate
I must try to find this girl! It is not because I
am told that her eyes are like mine, as there is
nothing remarkable in this; many have large dark
optics," and she laughed, "but because something
continually goads me with the conviction that she
is my child."</p>

<p>"And have you not told Pearl?"</p>

<p>"No, I could not bear to trouble him as my
poor heart is agitated; and it would be an additional
grief to have him treat the matter with
incredulity. He too must wait for the unfolding."</p>

<p>"But your mother? How will she ever account
for the young lady's disappearance? How can
either of you forgive what she has done if it is
proven that Lily Gaylord is your child?"</p>

<p>Lillian started to her feet, while Mrs. Cheevers
looked wildly towards the door. A low, wailing
cry as if a heart was being crushed had reached
them from the outside, and their cheeks blanched
as they listened. For a moment the two listened
to their heart's throbbings as the stillness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
death settled down about them; then a sound as of
one falling broke the silence. Lillian rushed to
the door in time to clasp the inanimate form of her
mother before the poor head struck the floor upon
which she was kneeling. It was true! <i>She had
been listening!</i> The upper part of the door did
not close tightly, and it was to this opening that
her ear had been placed until the brain reeled and
she sank upon her knees.</p>

<p>"O my mother!" almost shrieked the distracted
daughter as she attempted to raise her.</p>

<p>Mr. Cheevers heard the cry and came rushing
up the stairs, and the wretched woman was soon
carried to her bed, where, in a short time, the family
physician was in attendance. For many weeks
the proud, erring Mrs. Belmont lay tossing upon
her bed in wild delirium, and Lillian stood by and
listened to her ravings.</p>

<p>"I did not do it! Look&mdash;there is no blood on
my hands! It was <i>she</i>! It was she! Let me
look again; yes&mdash;the same purple spots; Lillian!
Lillian! Why won't you come to me? I did not
do it! It was the sea&mdash;the wicked, cruel sea! O
my curse! It has fallen back upon my poor head!
It is burning up my brain! O God! But he
won't hear! The fires&mdash;<i>the fires!</i>"</p>

<p>In vain did the untiring watcher breathe into
her ears the words of sympathy and forgiveness,
but the whirling brain caught them not. The
tenderest of hands bathed the burning brow and
administered to her every necessity. It was a
long, a fearful struggle between life and death;
but when the spring days were all past, and the
warm summer sun shone down upon the fresh
young grass in the public squares, Mrs. Belmont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
lay with folded hands and worn-out frame in quiet
helplessness upon the bed, where for so many
weeks she had tossed in frantic delirium. The
poor clogged brain had been relieved of its heavy
load and the burdened conscience quieted, and now
the reaction had come and Lillian again prayed
and waited!</p>

<p>"If she would but speak to me or show some
signs of recognition," Lillian had said one day to
her aunt, as they stood looking at the pale, wan
face upon the pillow. "It is so hard to see her
lying there day after day so still and passive, taking
all that is given her without a word or gesture!
Terrible fears at times take possession of me&mdash;what
if she never recovers her reason! The doctor
has hinted such a possibility if I am not mistaken,
and I dare not ask him if my suspicions are
correct." The quivering lids were slowly raised
for one moment from over the large eyes, where a
most pitiful pleading look was hidden, and the
longing glance fastened itself on the troubled face
beside her.</p>

<p>"Mother, dear Mother, do you know me? Speak
just one word to your poor Lillian;" and she
kissed tenderly the firmly set lips. Again the
lids slowly fell and the dark orbs were shut in with
their unfathomed mysteries.</p>

<p>"This is dreadful!" and with tears streaming
down her face the aunt turned and walked from
the room.</p>

<p>Weeks passed away and Mrs. Belmont was able
to sit for hours in her easy chair, but the once active,
energetic and massive intellect was weak and
inefficient as that of a child. The large eyes
would follow the flitting forms about her with a
weird wistful look, yet she seldom spoke, and
when she did, the words revealed the sad truth
that the powers that had long sat enthroned in the
realm of reason ruled no more.</p>

<p>"I must go," Lillian said to her aunt one day,
as they drew the invalid chair close to the window
where a cool breeze from the Schuylkill could fan
her pale face, and, as the words fell on the ears of
Mrs. Belmont a quick flush overspread it. The
daughter noticed the change with joy and a
strange wondering. "Mrs. Jackson can do all that
is needed to be done now," she continued, without
removing her gaze from the placid features.
"I will not be absent more than a week at most,
and Pearl, you know, writes that if he can obtain
leave for a few days will be here by my return."</p>

<p>"Pearl?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother; would you like to see him?"</p>

<p>There was a struggling among the buried
memories which were not dead but sleeping, for
the eyes gleamed with a new light, and the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
resumed its look of intelligence. It was only
for a moment, however, and then the former inertness
returned, as she repeated, "Pearl!"</p>

<p>"He loves you, Mother; shall I read what he
wrote last?" There was no response, and taking
the letter from her pocket, she read slowly and distinctly.
"She is our mother, Lillian, and, no
matter what she has done, it is the duty of her
children to forgive, and never refer to the past.
I am anxious to meet her for her daughter's sake.
My heart opens wide to take in her love and
bury the whole hateful past. Whisper my name
to her gently, familiarize her brain with associations
concerning me."</p>

<p>"He is coming to see you, Mother, to love
you; are you glad?"</p>

<p>"Forgive? Did he say forgive?"</p>

<p>"He certainly did, and he is true to his word.
Shall I tell him to come?" The large eyes fixed
intently on the beaming face before her, as if
endeavoring to pierce the shadows.</p>

<p>After a moment's silence the mother slowly
answered "Tell him come," and settled back in
her chair wearied and exhausted.</p>

<p>Lillian was exuberant. "She is better," was
her conclusion as she adjusted the pillows and
brushed back the thin hair from the white temples.
The heavy braids were gone, and the
queenly bearing lost in helpless weakness.</p>

<p>It was finally concluded that Mrs. Hamilton
should leave her mother in the care of the efficient
nurse who had been in attendance during
her long sickness, and, without speaking to her
upon the subject, proceed on her journey to
Boston, to return as soon as possible. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
on the following morning she started on
her exciting mission. What a threefold cord was
drawing her! The mother, to whose helplessness
her filial love was clinging; the idolized
husband for whom her heart was pining; and now
the living tendrils of a buried affection had
sprung up, and were twining themselves with an
unseen power around the vibrating cord that
bound her life to earthly loves and earthly hopes.
The mother-love had awakened with its pleadings
and would not be hushed. A little more than a
year ago, and the brittle thread that held her was
feeble, and the fibres frail; now other strands had
been added, and as the car rolled over the
space that separated her from the consummation
of her long-cherished hopes she thanked God
for the tender hand that had led her. The great
joy, however, that would sweep over her soul,
as she recalled the reasons of her present mission,
was not without its gloomy apprehensions.
What if, after all, Mrs. Gaylord's adopted daughter
was not her Lily? How was she to be sure?
and then the mother's ravings, her wild confessions;
her cries of innocence; certainly these
must have come from the hidden consciousness
of an appalling truth! She sat by the open window
and watched the receding fields, the trees
and villages, as the train sped through them, with
a sensation of alarm, for she realized that every
puff of the tireless engine brought her nearer
and nearer to the acme of her hopes or to disappointment.</p>

<p>How her limbs trembled when, on reaching
Boston, she entered a carriage and gave orders
to be driven to the Parker House! In Boston at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
last! In this boiling cauldron of living souls should
she find her child? What a thought! What a
hope! She must rest. Sleep alone could give
her strength of body for the trying ordeal. She
partook of a hasty lunch and retired to her room.
What if Mrs. Gaylord had left the city. It had
been so long since the boy had told her she was
here. Here was a new agony! She had not
thought of that; and ringing the bell asked for
a directory.</p>

<p>Bowing, the servant turned to bring it.</p>

<p>"Stay, perhaps you can tell me how far it is
to Mr. Bancroft's store."</p>

<p>"Peter Bancroft, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"He is just one block away, ma'am: Shall we
send your card?"</p>

<p>"Yes." She had not known before what were
her wishes, and she wrote her address opposite
her name and requested an interview. In a half
hour the servant returned.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bancroft is in the parlor, ma'am, and
will meet you there. Will you be kind enough
to come immediately as his business is pressing?"</p>

<p>Lillian arose quickly and followed the servant.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for troubling you, but I
am anxious to find a Mrs. Hudson Gaylord.
Are you the Mr. Bancroft with whom she is
acquainted?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, if you are her friend I rejoice to meet
you;" and he extended his hand.</p>

<p>"I am not acquainted with her, but would like
to learn if she has a young lady whom she claims
as an adopted daughter?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lily? Certainly! But they are not in the
city." She started and he hurried to say: "She
is only an hour's ride away. You can get to her
before ten in the morning. There is a little hotel
out in Kirkham where she has a fancy to spend
her summers rather than at a fashionable watering
place, and I believe it was in that vicinity
where she found her two protegees. If I can assist
you in any way I shall be happy to do so." He
arose to depart. Lillian extended her hand; with
many thanks and exchanging good-nights they
separated, the merchant to forget perhaps the
trifling incident in the press of business, the other
to her lonely room and rest.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I am glad," she thought as she closed
and bolted the door; "she&mdash;my child&mdash;is not here
and her mother has an hour's ride to get to her!"
Peacefully she rested on the threshold of a new
experience. Her heart throbbed wildly with hope
and fear as it peered through at the coming possibilities,
with new loves clamoring to be fed and
old ones struggling for precedence, and yet she
slept! The morning came and looked in through
the narrow aperture of the closed shutters, but
she did not wake. The gong sent its warning
echoes up through the broad halls but she slept
on. Eight o'clock and a loud knocking upon the
door awoke her, and bounding from her bed she
answered the summons.</p>

<p>"A gentleman in the parlor, ma'am, and wishes
to see Mrs. Hamilton."</p>

<p>"In just one moment!" and she hurriedly made
herself ready to meet her visitor.</p>

<p>"The train would leave for Kirkham in a half
hour, and Mr. Bancroft would be happy to see her
safely upon it." This was the word he sent her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Hamilton is grateful and will be ready
after a hasty cup of coffee."</p>

<p>So soon! The time had come but how strong
she was! Not a tremor shook her frame; not an
emotion quickened her pulse! Mr. Bancroft
assisting her to a seat in the carriage, entered and
took one beside her.</p>

<p>"We shall not be late? I slept so soundly.
Really I forgot to wake this morning, and must
thank you for reminding me of it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton laughed and Mr. Bancroft looked
into the beaming eyes and thought "how like
Lily Gaylord's they are!"</p>

<p>"You spoke last evening of two protegees?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a brother of the young lady&mdash;and a cripple."</p>

<p>"A brother, did you say?" and the heart of his
listener gave a great bound of pain. The carriage
suddenly wheeled up at the station, and "all
aboard for the West" was shouted.</p>

<p>"This way Mrs. Hamilton," and her escort
handed her into the car, and wishing her success
waved his adieus as the train moved on.</p>

<p>"Her brother! Then she is not my child!
Have I been led thus far only to find the fruit that
allured me with its golden brightness nothing but
ashes? Can it be?" With fearful apprehensions
the hour flew by; the junction was reached at last.</p>

<p>It was a short ride to the hotel, and as she
entered the spruce-looking village inn sensation of
suffocation caused her to throw back her veil that
she might breathe more freely.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Gaylord in?" she asked of a sweet-faced
little woman who appeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>"They have gone for their morning ride, but
will be back in a half hour at most."</p>

<p>"I will take a room and wait their coming,"
was Lillian's response, and the hostess was ready
to conduct her thither. It was a pleasant chamber
overlooking the maple grove where the "lady
from the south" had found so many cool breaths,
and which now presented its most winning aspect
to her who was gazing with anxious agitation into
its shades. They had gone! In half an hour!
Could she wait? And yet how she dreaded its
passing! But the wings of time never cease their
rapid motion, and before she had bathed her face
or removed her bonnet a rap upon the door announced
that her hour had come. Mrs. Gaylord
was ready to receive her visitor.</p>

<p>"Will you ask her to grant me the favor to
come to my room?"</p>

<p>This request was made with trembling voice,
and the hostess wonderingly went with her message.
Then a step was heard along the hall and
the door again opened, and the same gentle voice
to which she had twice listened announced "Mrs.
Gaylord."</p>

<p>Lillian arose and the two ladies stood face to
face with a world of hidden mysteries between
them. Mrs. Gaylord extended her hand, and Lillian
smiled as the door closed behind the retreating
figure of the curious landlady.</p>

<p>"You are surprised at this intrusion from a
stranger, but you will neither wonder or blame
when you have listened to my story, and as it is a
long one let us sit by the window."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaylord affably obeyed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you a young lady with you; an adopted
daughter, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The lady moved uneasily in her chair.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what you know about her
history?"</p>

<p>"She can do this better than I. Shall I call
her?"</p>

<p>"No, no! I want to talk with you; but first
answer this one question: Has she a brother?"</p>

<p>"A foster-brother as she calls the noble cripple,
who is now with her in our private parlor."</p>

<p>A gleam of joy darted into her beautiful eyes at
this clearing away of the shadows, and she proceeded.</p>

<p>"Another question; by what name was she
called before you bestowed your own upon her?"</p>

<p>Her listener laughed. "In her years of babyhood
she gloried in the appellation of 'Phebe
Blunt,' and in six years or thereabouts this was
changed to 'Phebe Evans;' at fourteen it was
again changed to 'Lily Gaylord,' the one to which
she will now answer."</p>

<p>"Why Lily?"</p>

<p>"Because of a little fanciful dream of her early
childhood. She was born near the sea, and lived
in a fisherman's cabin, but somehow learned that
somebody had called her 'Lily Pearl,' and from
this she drew the conclusion that a beautiful lady
had picked her up off the waves where the pearls
had thrown her."</p>

<p>The speaker looked up to behold the face of her
listener as ashy pale as though the hand of death
had chilled it with its icy touch, while the pallid
lips were vainly endeavoring to speak; and, darting
from her chair, Mrs. Gaylord exclaimed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
alarm. "What is the matter with you? Are you
dying?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" she answered feebly, as the reaction
came and the blood rushed back to face and brow.
"Not dying, but entering a double life. Mrs.
Gaylord, your adopted daughter is my child! My
Lily Pearl! Oh, how can I explain! How prove
to you or her my assertion! How my heart has
hungered and starved for the love my baby awoke
in it! Seventeen years have I endured this thirsting
which cruel hands imposed upon me. O, for
strength to bear the change!" And she raised
her clasped hands supplicatingly, while her companion
looked on wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Let me explain," she added, and went on to
tell as well as she could, without reflecting blame
on the weak, helpless one far away, the story of her
wrongs and years of suspicion.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Belmont, of Rosedale, your mother?"
was the abrupt question that startled the narrator,
and caused her folded hands to tremble under the
soft pressure those of her interrogator placed on
them.</p>

<p>"Yes; she is my mother, and is now in Philadelphia,
a wreck of what she was when with you
in Savannah."</p>

<p>"The mystery is explained, the problem solved!
Lily, my Lily, is your child! I might have known
such a blessing could not be retained by me. I am
selfish, and, although I pity you, would rejoice at
your continued thirst if the sweetest luxury my
heart has ever known could have been spared to
me. You have a husband to adore, a mother to
forgive, a God your soul worships, while I am
starving, with none of these things to satisfy my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
undying cravings. Is there no pity in your
woman's heart for such as I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. You have a husband, wealth and
position. More than this, God waits for you. How
then can you be so desolate?"</p>

<p>"Ask your daughter by and by why she never
ceased to pine for the 'beautiful lady' that picked
her up from off the sea where the pearls had
thrown her? Did the bright picture that cast its
glittering rays only on the surface of her unsatisfied
heart feed or nourish the cravings of her
growing love? Can such cold star-beams warm
the frozen fountain? Do the fleshly ties of life
unite the aspiring soul with its higher destinies?
Love is the strong cord that draws us heavenward.
Can woman with her immortality be happy
when its drawings are all earthward? But I am
troubling you with my individual perplexities
when I ought to be lifting yours. I cannot, however,
tell you how much anguish and desolation
your story has thrown into my prospective future.
I was lonely and sad, and she came to fill the void.
I am childless, and her presence has satisfied my
heart's longings. But it is over now. Come with
me while with my own hand I tear the brightness
out of my life. Come!"</p>

<p>Lillian Hamilton followed her guide with unsteady
step along the hall toward the little front
parlor where her heart was to take up the broken
link which had been for so many years severed
in the chain of her eventful life; and her
thoughts stood still with a mingled sensation of
awe and fear, as her shrinking feet bore her
forward to the relinking.</p>

<p>The door opened, and opposite on a sofa sat two
young people, evidently in close conversation.
Lillian stepped back.</p>

<p>"'Make omens, go make omens,' Crazy Dimis
once said, you remember." It was Willie who was
speaking, but Mrs. Gaylord interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Omens will make themselves sometimes without
our help, my boy. Lily, dear Lily, the hour has
come for you to gather them." Mrs. Hamilton
stepped forward into the room. "Here is a lady,
my child, who wants to see you," and she motioned
Willie to come to her as she darted back into the
hall. Without a moment's hesitation, the boy
dropped from his seat and sped across the floor
after his usual manner, for the old timidity had
left him during his years in Boston; but the
tearful eyes of the visitor were upon him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>When the door closed Lily said, "Did I understand
that you wanted to see me?" She had risen
from the sofa, and now stood before the new-comer,
her large, dreamy eyes full of wonder and amazement.</p>

<p>"Lily Pearl!" fell from the quivering lips in a
low minor strain, as the mother bird cries for its
lost. "Lily Pearl! My Lily! My baby!" and
the pleading arms were outstretched. With a
shriek of excitement and joy the young girl sprang
forward, and the head was once more pillowed on
on the breast where so many years ago in infancy
it had rested for a few short moments.</p>

<p>"My mother! It is, it must be, my mother!"
Tears such as seldom moisten woman's eyes fell
in a baptismal shower on the beautiful face that
lay so lovingly over the wildly throbbing heart,
where the sweet flowers of God's purest affections
had blossomed, faded, died. The minutes flew
past on airy wings, and still the mother and
daughter remained clasped in each other's arms,
and heart pulsated against heart, and life mingled
itself with life, until parent and child were bound
together, never to be rudely torn asunder until the
icy hand of death should break the welded link.
Raising the head tenderly, she looked into the
lovely face long and lovingly. "Pearl's noble brow
and expressive mouth," she said at last. "But
they were right; you have your mother's eyes, my
darling. May they never weep such hopeless
tears as have mine."</p>

<p>"Who is 'Pearl,' Mother? And who am I?"
The dreamy eyes had put away their beams of
ecstacy, and the old wondering light had come
back as she asked these questions, "Who am I?
And who is Pearl?"</p>

<p>"You shall know all, <i>everything</i>, my child; but
my heart is too full of its present joy to relish the
thought of bringing up the hateful past for one
moment. But you must know. 'Pearl' is my
husband and your father, and a truer or nobler
man never lived. We were married before I was
as old as you, my darling, while a school girl in
Philadelphia, but my mother, who was proud and
aspiring, looked with disfavor upon our union, for
he was the son of a poor widow. And coming on
from her southern home she compelled me by her
resistless power to go with her, leaving the idol
of my young heart behind&mdash;forever as she intended,
but it has proved otherwise. In 'Cliff
House,' by the sea, you were born; and as I
clasped you to my heart, overflowing with maternal
love, I said, 'She shall be called Lily-Pearl (<i>our</i>
names combined), and then they took you from
me, and days after, when reason and consciousness
returned, I was told that my beautiful Lily had
been 'transplanted to a purer clime,' and my soul
was desolate. We traveled in Europe, and every
pleasure that could be gleaned from social life and
the pleasures of sight-seeing were thrown into my
years, yet my heart was unsatisfied. I loved Pearl
Hamilton; the little life that had sprung from our
union had grievously torn my own in the severing,
and nothing could heal the wound. Added to this
was the continuous suspicion that a bitter wrong
had been done me. The more I thought it over
and reviewed the attending circumstances, the more
did this suspicion fasten itself upon my soul. I
accused my mother of treachery, attempted to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
from her some explanations regarding certain
things, but her superior power always succeeded
in silencing my wailing cry, and time rolled on.
It was by accident that I heard of a Mrs. Gaylord's
adopted daughter. George St. Clair, whom my
mother had insisted upon my accepting as her
son-in-law, joined the army about the time that I
left my home under a mother's curse. With an
aunt in New Orleans I found refuge. Here I conceived
the idea of drowning my long-endured
sorrows in the engrossing cares of the hospitals.
Almost a year ago, while nursing my husband,
who had been badly wounded, George St. Clair
was brought in, who also had been laid aside from
duty by a fearful wound. From his sister, who
had come to nurse him, I heard the sad story of
your disappearance and probable loss."</p>

<p>Lily had slipped from her mother's knee, and,
sitting at her feet, was gazing intently into the
dear face, as the dear voice ceased. "Tell me, O,
tell me!" she exclaimed, pushing back her dark
hair with the old childhood's gesture: "Is Mrs.
Belmont your mother, and my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, darling; but notwithstanding all, you shall
see and will forgive her! Think, my dear, how
strangely we have been led together! Had it not
been for that terrible experience I might never
have heard of Mrs. Gaylord's adopted daughter, or
the resemblance between us. Then how strange
was it that, in my first burst of bliss, with feeble
hands, not knowing what I did, I should have
fastened to your fluttering, struggling life the
cord that was to draw us together after so many
years of separation! I had called you 'Lily-Pearl,'
and the strange appellation could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
lost! Sixteen years afterward, the end of this unbroken
cord was again put into my hands, and
with a continuous yearning it has brought us
together. Old Vina was right! 'De Lord will
take care ob His childerns, neber fear!' I know
you have many questions to ask and there is much
to be told you, but, darling, Mrs. Gaylord and
your friend will desire to come back to their room
and we must not exclude them. First tell me,
how is it that he is called your brother? How
did you come here when you were left somewhere
on the Maryland shore?"</p>

<p>"Because of my love for the sea and my desire
to get out upon the waves 'where the pearls had
thrown me, and my beautiful mother had picked
me up.' When lying in my trundle bed one night
I heard my foster parents talking about 'the five
hundred dollars' that had been paid them, and
laughed as one said, 'I guess her mother would
not think her much of a 'Lily-Pearl' could she
see her now.' Lily-Pearl! I asked Maria about
it, and she told me that my beautiful mother had
cast me off and hers had taken me in, and I ought
to love her. But the pretty story grew in my little
heart until it became a part of it, and I lived
and loved the sea for its sake. I was a pearl, and
had grown down where the pearls grew and the
waves talked to me about it, and one day as I was
wandering on the beach I sprang into a boat and
floated out on the billows where I had so longed to
go. I was happy, and sang and played with the
bright sunbeams on the waters until the night
came and a storm arose; and O how the billows
roared and the winds howled! My beautiful dream
of happiness was gone, and I sank down into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
wet, dirty boat, for the rain to pelt and the salt
waves to dash over me. I do not know when it
was, but Willie's father found me. On board his
ship we came to Boston. Upon its arrival he took
me to his home, only a little way from here, where
I was to be a companion to his crippled boy, who
has been the dearest brother to me ever since. He
is four years older than I. His mother before
she died gave him to me and told me never to leave
him, but his sister Fanny did not like my being
there for her to support, and so I went away. Mr.
Ernest, the pastor of the church yonder, told Mrs.
Gaylord about me, and I came here to read to her;
here you have found me. But, Mother, I can
never forget or forsake him. It was he who taught
me to seek knowledge and read good books and
love God; all I am he put it into my heart to be."</p>

<p>"My dear child, your mother would have you
cherish tenderly these early tokens of love. But
call your friends, darling, and let us talk together
of what must be. It is hard after all I have experienced
to compel my hand to sever a single
earthly tie; but what can be done to lighten the
blow shall not be withheld."</p>

<p>It took days to clear away the mysteries and
shadows and dig thorns out of the path where so
many feet were to walk unitedly, although not
together at all times under the sunshine and the
clouds; but at last the work was done and Mrs.
Hamilton was to return to Philadelphia alone, as
she had come. Here she was to meet her husband
and break to him the joyful tidings that the dead
was alive and the lost found. Here also she was
to make ready for her daughter's reception as soon
as the cold winds of autumn should sweep down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
from the north, and Mrs. Gaylord desired to return
to her southern home.</p>

<p>"I shall have no wish to remain here alone,"
was her plaintive conclusion when the results were
being finally talked over. "No more music lessons
or German from poor Mrs. Rouche, Lily, and
another heart will grieve at your going."</p>

<p>"Better so than to have any one sorrow at my
coming," and Lily's happy face beamed with
joy. "You will remain a few days longer?" she
pleaded, breaking a short silence, and the wistful
eyes seconded the petition.</p>

<p>"Until after the sabbath," was Mrs. Hamilton's
quiet response. "Somehow I have a fancy to go
to that little church yonder; it reminds me so
much of one I attended in the suburbs of a Scottish
village. And then too, darling, I have been
thinking I must have your full length photograph
to show your father on my return, for it will be
hard to make him believe my story without this
pretty face to corroborate it." And she patted the
full-rounded cheek fondly. "If Mrs. Gaylord will
favor me with hers I will be very glad to be its
possessor."</p>

<p>"Do you not want Willie's?" The mother
smiled.</p>

<p>"Are you so jealous for your friend? Certainly
I do want his just as I saw it yesterday when coming
up to the door of the hotel&mdash;carriage, Rover
and all. It was a beautiful picture, and I have no
desire that it should fade from my memory. But
we are to ride to his home after dinner, I believe.
Will the sister give me welcome? I must thank
her for the part she has taken in the preservation
of my child!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins met them at the gate, for she had
become pleased with the frequent visits of her
stylish acquaintance at the hotel, notwithstanding
her indignation at the interference in regard to
her wishes as to "Phebe's" remaining "where
she could make herself useful;" but that was
passed, and to-day she was smiling and genial.
When the carriage stopped Lily called out:
"Where is Willie?"</p>

<p>"Down by the pond, I suppose; he went out
immediately after dinner."</p>

<p>"Go with me, Mother, will you? It is lovely,
and I want you to see the spot where I have spent
so many hours listening to the waves as they came
around the sand-bar."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton consented, and the ladies alighted
while Lily was saying, "Fanny, my mother has
come to thank you for all your kindness and care
of her child for so many years. Mrs. Colonel
Hamilton&mdash;my mother!"</p>

<p>This introduction was given hurriedly and with
a tremulous voice. The lady extended her hand
to the astonished Fanny, who took it in her own
without a word. Her eyes turned to the face of
Mrs. Gaylord, who answered the inquiring look.</p>

<p>"Did Willie not tell you? It is true the drifting
waif has found a home and loving friends who
have long mourned for her, and her days of
orphanage are over."</p>

<p>There were tears in Fanny's eyes, and Lily,
wishing to turn the current of thought, said playfully,
"It was by this gate that my little bare feet
entered alone to reconnoitre in advance of my guide,
to hand over the information that I did not like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
scour knives or wash potatoes, and I 'wouldn't do
it either!'"</p>

<p>"You were very good to take in my poor child
and give her shelter so long, while my heart was
breaking to find her. I have a great debt of gratitude
to pay, and if I can cancel the obligations due
for any expense she may have been to you or
yours, nothing would give me greater pleasure
than to do so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins found her voice now, and with
great distinctness informed the lady that there was
no debt to pay, either of gratitude or money.
"Willie told me that 'Phebe' had found a friend,
and I was glad, but did not know that a mother
had come to take her away from us forever." Here
she broke down, and, turning, hid her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>"Not forever, my dear Mrs. Hopkins, for while
we both shall live the friends of these dark days
shall not be forgotten or forsaken."</p>

<p>Lily had placed an arm about the weeping
woman, as she whispered "Fanny, you do not
know how much I love you. I have given you
any amount of trouble, have been selfish and
indolent, oftentimes grieving you with my bad
temper and willful ways. Will you forgive me?"</p>

<p>She did not speak, but an arm gently stole
around the neck of the suppliant, while the ladies
looked on with moistened eyes.</p>

<p>Then Lily said, "Under the white marble yonder
lies Fanny's mother and my friend. She loved
us both, and if she were here now her soft, blue
eyes would brighten with my great joy." She had
turned toward her mother as she said this, and her
own beautiful orbs glistened as she talked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>Fanny bent her head, and for the first time in
all the years kissed the glowing face of the poor
"little Phebe." "You are the one to forgive," she
said, bluntly. "I have been cold and harsh, but
it was not because I did not want you. The years
have been lonely ones with you away, and I could
not be reconciled to your leaving us after once
more being thrown back into my home; and you
are going to return no more."</p>

<p>"No, Fanny; we will ever be sisters, and you
must come to me. Besides, we will have time to
talk this over, for I am to remain through the
summer with Mrs. Gaylord, and will visit you
many times. My dear mother, let us go to the
lake for Willie while Mrs. Gaylord rests herself in
the cool parlor." And the two walked together
down through the garden to the meadow brook,
thence under the pines, where the carpet of
fragrant leaves lay soft and smooth, until reaching
the summit of the gentle slope, Lily espied the
object of her search stretched out upon the green
grass under the old oak tree, where he had often
watched her fragile form in the little open boat as
she gleefully pulled the long-stemmed lily from
the clear waters, where the 'pearls were holding it
fast,' until she was hidden from his view by the
thick cloud of scalding tears that had welled up
from his desolate heart. Lily remembered it all
now, as she stood for a moment and looked at him.</p>

<p>"You do not know how sorry I am for him,"
she said, turning her eyes full upon her companion.
"He will be very lonely without me."</p>

<p>"My child, tell me truly, do you love Willie
Evans?"</p>

<h3><a name="CHANGES_AND_REVOLUTIONS" id="CHANGES_AND_REVOLUTIONS"></a>CHANGES AND REVOLUTIONS.</h3>


<p>Pearl Hamilton, at nineteen, had been a clerk
in a flourishing mercantile house, nobly supporting
a widowed mother on his limited salary; but
at thirty-six, by dint of industry and "good luck"
as his fellows called his success, he was the owner
of an elegant home on Broad street, which his conservative
parent refused positively to occupy. Besides
this he had a good business and an income
adequate to his every desire. When the call was
made for seventy-five thousand men to maintain
the dignity of a free people he hastened to enroll
his name. "Why not?" he inquired of his weeping
mother, who protested against the separation;
"I leave only you to mourn me if I find a soldier's
grave, and what can this short existence do for me
but to crown it with duties well done? There are
not many who would have fewer ties to break or a
less number of hearts to make wretched." He
went, and in the first great battle was taken from
the ranks helpless as we have seen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton returned to her friends in Philadelphia
buoyant and happy. Still it was sad for
her to look upon the wreck of a once proud intellect,
and when the mother's eyes turned upon her
with their greetings she was glad that it had been
in her heart to smooth over the parent's transgressions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
But how would Pearl feel? How
could she reconcile him to all that had been?
Would he forgive when the whole truth was revealed?
These thoughts troubled her, and when
at last he arrived in the city on an unlimited
leave, and she looked into his fine manly face, her
heart rebuked her for the distrust she had experienced.
Mrs. Cheevers had been told the whole
story of the finding and waiting, and the uncle
had many times vented his indignation at "the
foolish idea of leaving her so near the water, where
she might at any time be compelled through inclination
or force of arms to take another ride not
quite so successful in its ending," but Lillian had
said: "I could not bring her here dear uncle just
at this time, for fear the struggling intellect would
again totter. Then Pearl&mdash;how <i>could</i> I present
her to him? It is better as it is, for I want my
husband's advice regarding the future."</p>

<p>"Woman's propensity! Delightful independence
when the current is all the right way! But
I tell you, Lillian, I want to see that girl! The
same independent looking little queen that her
mother used to be! And this boy&mdash;he has a fine
head, and without doubt is a smart young fellow;"
and he handed back the photographs at
which he had been gazing.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gaylord has such a pensive expression
on her face that one might imagine her the possessor
of some secret sorrow," remarked the wife,
thoughtfully. "Her eyes and compressed lips."</p>

<p>"Not sad perhaps, Auntie, but disappointed!
As nearly as I could understand by the long conversations
we had together she belongs to that
class of mature women who in early years dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
up their future in spotless white, with very bright
adornings, and because they found it wearing a
most common, practical garb, turned away from
its proffers of good to grieve and grow discontented.
Mrs. Gaylord has a truly poetical mind,
whose creations are pure and ideal. She thought
love was a holy aspiration unmixed with earthly
blemishes, but has awakened to the realization of
her mistake, therefore cannot be reconciled to the
practical side of life. Her last words at parting
unsealed the book of her history. 'Good-bye!'
she said: 'If a heart that is feasting can pity a
hungry, starving one then think of me!'"</p>

<p>"Poor soul; I am sorry for her!" remarked
Mrs. Cheevers sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Because of the bond of sympathy twisted out
of a similar experience, I suppose," laughed the
husband as he arose to leave the room. "By the
way, I imagine that Colonel Hamilton will be here
to-day, wife; shall I send up something nice from
the market?"</p>

<p>"Not before to-morrow morning, Uncle; he
writes he will take the night train from Washington
to save time!"</p>

<p>"Horrors! He is as slow as molasses in winter;"
and the front door gave an expressive bang
as it closed behind him.</p>

<p>Colonel Hamilton arrived in due time, however,
and was received with open arms. "Tell her I
have come, Lillian," he said, before proceeding to
the invalid's room. "I am in a hurry to meet
her. The shock may be too great if I go unannounced."</p>

<p>Lillian obeyed and sprang with light step up
the stairway and entered her mother's room. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
was sitting by the window while Mrs. Jackson
was putting the finishing touches to her toilet,
for, weak as were her faculties, pride had not become
inactive. Her dress must be perfect and her
adornings ample as in other days.</p>

<p>"How nicely you are looking this beautiful
morning," said the daughter, adjusting the rich
lace at the throat. "All ready for company I see&mdash;whom
shall I invite?"</p>

<p>The large eyes looked steadily into the beaming
face for a moment, then as they turned languidly
away said, hesitatingly: "Charles."</p>

<p>"You want to see your boy, don't you Mother?
Well you shall if he can be found! He was at
Uncle Stanley's the last I heard of him. We will
look him up by and by." A smile darted quickly
over the pale face.</p>

<p>"Is there no one else you would like to see?
What if Pearl should come; shall I bring him to
you?" Again the eyes darted a keen glance into
the inquiring face. "You will love him; he is so
good and forgiving!"</p>

<p>"Forgive? No! no! Pearl,&mdash;Can he forgive?"
And the tears came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"He will forgive! It is all over now, and we
are very happy. Let me bring him to you, and
from his own lips you shall hear it. May I?"</p>

<p>"No! no! I was wicked, cruel! He cannot,
no, he cannot!" And the stately head dropped
wearily upon her hand, while the elbow rested
on the arm of her easy chair.</p>

<p>"How nice that dainty cap, with its bright ribbons,
makes you look. He will be proud of our mother,
and it will make me so happy!"</p>

<p>"You happy?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Mother; your Lillian; may I go for
him?"</p>

<p>There was a long pause, for the poor brain was
struggling with itself, as one battles with sleep
when the morning dawns. The answer came at
last.</p>

<p>"Yes, go get&mdash;Pearl. I am ready!"</p>

<p>Lillian smoothed the soft dark hair, petted her
sunken cheek with her white hand, and, as she
kissed the broad forehead, remarked playfully,
"You are as pretty as a young girl waiting for
her lover."</p>

<p>She encountered her husband just outside the
door. "Come in," she said, "Mother is waiting to
see you;" and, for the first time Pearl Hamilton
stood in the presence of Mrs. Belmont.</p>

<p>With a quick step he approached her chair, and
kneeling at her feet, said gently, "Mother, bless
your son, it was I who disappointed you, I who
tempted you to do wrong; will you forgive me?
There have been dark clouds, but they are gone
now; put your hand on my head and call me
Pearl, this will make us happy."</p>

<p>She did not move or raise her hand, but sat
motionless as a marble statue, with her gaze
riveted on the upturned face.</p>

<p>Lillian took the thin hand and laid it tenderly
on the bowed head as she whispered, "forgive
him, Mother."</p>

<p>"No, no!" she exclaimed, drawing it quickly
back. "Forgive? I did not know! See! there
is no blood on my hand; look!" and she held
it up before the wondering suppliant, who turned
his inquiring eyes towards his trembling wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not do it!" she continued; "'twas the
sea&mdash;the wicked sea! Forgive? O God! But
He will not hear me! I did not do it!" and the
head sank back upon its resting place.</p>

<p>"I ought not to have come; how her mind wanders!"
whispered Colonel Hamilton, rising.</p>

<p>"Mother, listen to me," said Lillian, taking the
hand which lay so motionless on the rich dress,
"I know there is no blood there, for the sea was
not wicked, and the little boat was taken care of
by the precious One, who will hear when you
call. There is much for you to know that will
make you happy; but first let us brush the cobwebs
out of the present. Old Vina would say,
'Bress de Lord for what ye now hab,' and you
have not made me happy yet by receiving and
loving my husband. Open your arms, Mother, to
your son, for he is waiting."</p>

<p>She raised her head, and with outstretched arms
said, plaintively, "My son, my son!"</p>

<p>The strong arms of love and forgiveness were
thrown about her, and, weary as a child, she laid
her head upon his shoulder and remained motionless
as a sleeping infant. He would not disturb
her and the moments went slowly by.</p>

<p>"Put me on the bed," she said at last; "the
sea!&mdash;O the sea!"</p>

<p>The arms that were folding her so gently, lifted
her in their strong grasp, laying her gently on the
bed, where, turning her face to the wall, she lay
motionless.</p>

<p>"I think you may better leave her now," remarked
Mrs. Jackson, coming in at the heavy
tread. "She needs rest and a little sleep will
refresh her."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not expect to find her as she is," remarked
Colonel Hamilton, as they seated themselves
in the parlor below. "What did she mean about
the 'sea,' and the 'blood on her hands,' Lillian?
I noticed you understood it all."</p>

<p>"Yes, Pearl, I do understand! You are to know
as well as I. But how can I tell you! O, my
husband, there is much yet to be forgiven! Is
your heart large enough for the demands to be
made upon it?"</p>

<p>"You startle me, Lillian! Do not make me
fear for the sanity of my darling wife! What can
there be that will draw harder upon my powers
of forgiveness than what I have already experienced?
Do not fill those beautiful eyes with such
a strange look. I am Pearl Hamilton, who has
become familiar with injustice and wrongs; and if
there are more to confront, know then that they cannot
daunt or alarm me! I wait, Lillian, what is it?"</p>

<p>She looked at him a moment in surprise and admiration.
"And this noblest type of man is my
husband!" she said, earnestly. "I will tell you
about my trip to Boston."</p>

<p>"Not now; I can wait for that. What about
the sea?"</p>

<p>"We must go around a little to get there, so
permit me to lead as I choose."</p>

<p>With an air of martyrdom he folded his arms
over the golden bands of his military coat and
prepared to suffer.</p>

<p>"You have never once inquired as to my business.
A careful officer should be more interested
in the affairs of those under his command."</p>

<p>"Well, imagine my interest wide awake, and
hurry on to the sea."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will not trifle with you, Pearl. I went in
search of a young girl in whose history I had become
nervously interested. George and Ellen St.
Clair told me about her; and in Virginia a young
soldier, who was brought to the hospital, added
some information that awakened an uncontrollable
desire in my heart to see her. I went to Boston
for that purpose."</p>

<p>"Woman's curiosity!" he laughed. "Did you
find her?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"What was she like?"</p>

<p>"I have her picture. Shall I show it to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if it will hasten you to the sea."</p>

<p>Lillian arose, and taking from the table the
three photographs, returned to the sofa. "This is
a Mrs. Gaylord, who has the girl in her care&mdash;a
southern lady of great wealth, I believe."</p>

<p>"Gaylord? Let me see. There was a rebel
scout of that name brought before me just as I
left, and I ordered him kept in the guard-house
until my return."</p>

<p>"Hudson Gaylord?"</p>

<p>"That was it, as sure as you live. Hudson
Gaylord! A fine-looking fellow, but caught in a
pretty bad trap, I am thinking."</p>

<p>"Pearl, he is this lady's husband. You must
do all you can for him. Promise me this."</p>

<p>"Why? I see no reason for interfering with
justice because you have in your possession a
photograph of his wife. But go on."</p>

<p>"This, Pearl, is the picture of the young lady in
whom I was so much interested." She held it up
before him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>He started back in surprise. "Who is she?"
he gasped. "I should say it was yours, dress and
all, just as I saw you first in this very house.
Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Look at that brow and the <i>hauteur</i> of the compressed
lips. They are not mine."</p>

<p>"But the eyes and the queenly bearing, the
slender form and white dress&mdash;. Taken as a whole,
there could scarcely be a better representation of
yourself when fourteen."</p>

<p>"Believe me, my husband, for what I am going
to tell you is true. That picture is our child!"</p>

<p>"Lillian, are you mad?" And he started to his
feet and stood gazing at her. "Our child! You
told me she was dead. And how can this be?"</p>

<p>"She is ours! Our Lily-Pearl! She did not
die, but was taken from me and given to the
wife of a fisherman who was to care for her for
a paltry sum; but God interfered and has twice
saved her from the sea and many dangers, and she
is now called the adopted daughter of this Mrs.
Gaylord, for whose husband I have been pleading."</p>

<p>"Lillian, are you awake? Or am I dreaming?
Tell me again. Is this our child?"</p>

<p>"Our Lily-Pearl! Worthy the name she bears,
and as true and noble as your child must be. Can
you forgive? There is a long story for you to
listen to, but it was to hide her wrongs that the
wicked sea now haunts our mother's weakened
brain. The blood upon her hands is the mark
conscience has placed there, but how thankful am
I that no such crime blackens her soul."</p>

<p>He was walking the floor with rapid steps, and
apparently not listening, for he held in his hand
the picture that was entrancing him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>Lillian said no more, but waited. At last he
stopped before her and asked huskily, "Why did
you not bring her to me? This is cruel! You
have feasted your eyes on her beauty, heard her
sweet voice speak words of love that have satisfied
your heart, and now is this Mrs. Gaylord to retain
her and rob me? I believe I am angry with you,
my precious wife."</p>

<p>"No, no, Pearl; she is coming to us just as soon
as we are ready to receive her. I could not well
burden them farther here, and so I waited to consult
you. Mrs. Gaylord is very sad about giving
her up, but she is ours; and Lily is anxious to
meet her father."</p>

<p>"Then I shall go for her. If there is no room
in Philadelphia for the daughter of Pearl Hamilton,
then I will take her to Washington with me.
Get yourself ready, for to-morrow we start for
Boston. I will see this child, our daughter."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_HAZY_MISTS_ARE_LIFTING" id="THE_HAZY_MISTS_ARE_LIFTING"></a>THE HAZY MISTS ARE LIFTING.</h3>


<p>Colonel and Mrs. Hamilton arrived in Boston in
due time. There had been long talks by the way,
much questioning and wondering, but true to the
dictates of a noble, generous soul, he had said,
"Notwithstanding all, I will forgive."</p>

<p>When the train left the station for Kirkham on
the following morning, many eyes were turned on
the glittering colonel who, with his wife, entered
the car and took a seat near the door.</p>

<p>"Let us go farther on;" requested Lillian, as
he stepped back for her to enter. "There is a seat
yonder."</p>

<p>"Yes, but twelve steps farther away from her;"
and he laughed at the absurdities of his own
heart.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said at last, "there is a
greater conflict before you than any in which you
have engaged during the war? Mrs. Gaylord is
no enemy, yet I believe you will be hardly able to
resist her pleadings."</p>

<p>"Shall I remove my regimental straps now, or
wait to lay my sword at her feet?"</p>

<p>"You may wait, but be assured it must be done!
You can laugh now but you will pity her. Lily
is fresh, sweet and pure, and has nestled close
under the drooping wings of her pining love, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
a wound must be made in the severing. Can you
do this?"</p>

<p>"Little novice! Do you ask a soldier such a
question as that?"</p>

<p>There was a serious look on his face, notwithstanding
his careless words, but his heart was
buoyant! It was his child that was so soon to
rest her beautiful head so near it! His own darling
who was to drive away the last of its desolation,
and how could he intrude into its bright
chambers, so full of sunshine, the sombre shadow
of another's grief? He pitied her, and would use
his influence to liberate her husband and send him
out of harm's way. What more could he do for
her? "She will ever have a claim on my sympathies,
and every kindness I can bestow to ease her aching
heart shall be cheerfully given; but Lillian, the
wound must be made;" he said, after a long silence.
"Our daughter, my dear, was taken by
Mrs. Gaylord for the purpose of administering to
this drooping love you are speaking of, and if by
her gentleness, sweetness and purity, she has succeeded
in awakening the sleepy bird, it is her
glory, not her debt. But when you talk about the
cripple, that is quite another thing. My warlike
propensities beat a retreat immediately before the
power of that battalion. They were children together;
and it was only love and kindness in its
purest guise that has united them, and to wound
such a heart is a little hard."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton sat a long time thinking of the
prostrate form beneath the old oak tree as it first
met her gaze. It was all over&mdash;the shady resorts
were to be vacated forever; the path by the
meadow brook would be trodden by other feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
while the little pond with all its enchantments was
to be cast among the fond memories of the past.
Lillian's heart grew sad as these gloomy prospects
came to her. She was aroused at length by the
call, "Kirkham&mdash;next station," and turned to behold
her husband looking intently at her.</p>

<p>"As fine as a panorama, my dear," he said with
a merry twinkle in his eye. "Your face has had
all the changes of the 'dissolving views,' and I
have been permitted to look at them without paying
the usual quarter."</p>

<p>"A trifle dishonest, though, for a gentleman,"
was the playful retort; then added, seriously:
"When two weeks ago I alone neared this station
every nerve quivered with excitement! I was
nearing my child&mdash;crossing the gulf of treachery
that had so long separated me from happiness!
My limbs trembled and nerves quivered! Instead
of all this you are as calm and expectant as on
the eve of meeting an old friend."</p>

<p>"Why not, little wife? You see the banks of
this terrible gulf were lowered a little, when, nearly
two years ago, my Lillian came over to meet me!"</p>

<p>"Here we are," interrupted the happy wife, rising
from her seat; "gulf or no gulf we are coming
together!"</p>

<p>The coachman bowed obsequiously as the two
emerged from the car.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Gaylord still at the hotel?" inquired
the lady.</p>

<p>"She is ma'am." And he closed the door and
drove away. Not a word was spoken during the
short ride, for an oppressive lull such as sometimes
precedes a storm had settled down over the
hearts of each, and it did not lift until the carriage
stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Gaylord came into the parlor to greet the
visitors with a hesitating step. She was alone!
After the introductions Mrs. Hamilton asked for
Lily. "Her father is so impatient to meet her,"
was the supplementary remark.</p>

<p>"She is spending the day with Willie, for the
purpose, no doubt, of giving me a foretaste of
what is to be."</p>

<p>"How far away," asked the colonel impatiently.</p>

<p>"Over two miles, yet she insisted upon walking
there, as he had come for her before breakfast."</p>

<p>"I will speak for the carriage;" and he left the
room hurriedly.</p>

<p>"My shadows which were almost impenetrable
are nevertheless thickening," remarked Mrs. Gaylord
when alone with Mrs. Hamilton. "News has
just reached me that takes the light out of the
borders of my clouds!"</p>

<p>"From the war?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mr. Gaylord, it seems, has been taken
prisoner while in citizen's dress, when out on a
scouting expedition, and it is quite uncertain what
will become of him. So many ties severed without
time given for the healing, empties life too rapidly
for the pulse to maintain its steady motion."</p>

<p>"It may be I can steady it a little! Your husband
is in the hands of the regiment of which
Colonel Hamilton has command, and he will use
his powers to secure his liberty."</p>

<p>"Do you know this?"</p>

<p>"He has told me. Mr. Gaylord was brought in
just as he was leaving for Washington. The debt
of gratitude we owe would, if nothing else, have
this influence."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are ready," called Colonel Hamilton from
the hall, and Lillian taking the hand of Mrs. Gaylord
said, soothingly:</p>

<p>"Cheer up, my dear friend, there is sunshine
enough for us all if we will only secure it, and we
will attempt to woo a little of it when all together
once more;" and then went out to join her husband
who was impatiently waiting.</p>

<p>"A true little country miss to take such a
walk," he remarked as they rolled on towards the
farm.</p>

<p>"She is used to it," interposed the coachman
with true "Yankee" freedom; "she has gone
over this road lots of times when she wasn't the
young lady she is to-day! You are her father I
suppose?"</p>

<p>Lillian laughed. "I have not introduced you,
Frank. This is my husband, and I suppose you
learned that Lily was my daughter when I was
here before."</p>

<p>"Yes ma'am; and I'm glad! But I needn't 'a'
been told that for one would know it to look at
you."</p>

<p>"But a little more doubt about the father?"
and Colonel Hamilton brought his hand down
firmly on the shoulder of the Yankee questioner,
while a merry peal of laughter rang out on the
summer air.</p>

<p>"Wal&mdash;no; but there's the house&mdash;and the
wheat is ripe enough this minute to harvest!"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> will go to the door," said Lillian as they
came to a halt at the gate; "Mrs. Hopkins, without
doubt, is very busy with her dinner, and we
will not disturb her by waiting for a reception."
She stepped down while speaking and walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
briskly towards the house. Before reaching it,
however, the door flew open and Lily darted into
the outstretched arms of her mother.</p>

<p>"I am so glad!" she exclaimed. "Come&mdash;Willie
is sick and it may be you can help him!"</p>

<p>"But, my dear, just wait for one moment; your
father wants to see you!"</p>

<p>In her excitement she had not thought of the
carriage, or the reasons for the unexpected visit,
or anything but that the companion of many
years had been lying insensible on the bed where
the departed one had bid them both farewell so
long ago! But the words startled her, and she
raised her head from its sweet rest on the dear
shoulder to discover a tall military officer standing
before them. All the dreams of her maturer
years, winged as they had been with glowing aspirations
of "what might be." She had so longed
to be something besides "little Phebe," to have
wings and fly away up among the clouds; to be a
bird on the highest tree on the summit of the
mountain; and now what was she?</p>

<p>"My daughter! My Lily!" and as he looked
at the wondering face his arms were outstretched
for the sweet love his great heart was longing for.
Without a word the fairy form sprang into them
and a pair of clinging arms were placed about his
neck. Long and silent was the embrace for the
heart was content.</p>

<p>"Darling, can you love your father? I am not
as good-looking as the one you so much resemble,
but will I do?"</p>

<p>The large eyes gleamed, and looking intently
at him, said: "I think you will!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>He caught her again in his arms and covered
her beaming face with kisses.</p>

<p>"There, darling; now let us go to Willie, for I
confess that my warmed heart is reaching out for
him also."</p>

<p>"O thank you! You will love him I know!"
and she preceded her parents into the house. Mrs.
Hopkins came forward to greet her visitors with
traces of tears still on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"He is better now, and the doctor says it is
only overexertion in the hot sun and perhaps a
little worry with it," and she led the way to his
room.</p>

<p>"I am so glad," Lily was saying with her arms
about his neck as they entered. "We will not go
out again until it is cooler!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" He saw Mrs. Hamilton and reached
out his hand.</p>

<p>"Here is my husband, Willie, who has learned
your worth before seeing you."</p>

<p>"A dull scholar I should be certainly if I had
not."</p>

<p>"And you find me only a poor cripple who is
obliged to creep through the dust just like any
other worm!" He tried to smile but it proved a
failure.</p>

<p>"No, my boy; not through the 'dust' just
now, but into my heart, where, thank God, there
is plenty of room for you!"</p>

<p>The physician, who had stepped out as they
entered now returned, and walking up to the bed
said, kindly: "You are all right now, Willie, but
you must be a little careful of yourself for a few
days and keep in the shade." And then he went
away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will stay to dinner?" pleaded Mrs. Hopkins;
"I have nothing very nice to give you."</p>

<p>"Shall we, darling?" This to his daughter.</p>

<p>The beautiful eyes added their plea, and the
carriage was ordered back to the hotel to return
for them at five.</p>

<p>While sitting in the parlor Lily told her father
of the mother's gift in the years gone by, adding:
"He is my brother&mdash;I can never forsake him;"
and the answer had been: "He shall not be forsaken.
I am too grateful for what I have received
willingly to sever a single thread that binds you
to the friends of your past."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins was standing in the door when
these words were spoken, but turned away with a
pain in her heart and a strange pallor on her
usually flushed face.</p>

<p>That evening there was a long consultation in
the little upper parlor of the village inn, and Mrs.
Gaylord had repeated the plea: "You will let her
remain with me until the summer heat is over? I
cannot return home now if I would, and it would
be insufferable here without her! As soon as the
maple leaves shall crimson and the birds go where
I cannot follow, I will come with her to Philadelphia
and stand between you no more. It will take
the intervening weeks to prepare my heart to endure
the separation. Certainly you cannot refuse
me this!" And the whole matter was given to
the daughter for a decision. She whispered it at
last in the ear of her doting father, as she hung
about his neck while he petted and caressed her:
"For Willie's sake, until he is stronger and able
to return to Boston I will remain."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty hard, my darling, but as there is no
appeal the subject is of course closed."</p>

<p>"But there is another of whom I have not told
you, whose heart will rejoice at this decision,"
Lily remarked playfully.</p>

<p>"Not a lover I hope," interposed the father.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a true lover! One who has helped me
in many a trying hour, and whose advice it has
always been safe to follow. You need not draw
down that military mustache so threateningly, for
this 'lover' is no other than 'Crazy Dimis,' who
is even now free from the restraints of the 'county
house' and is roaming about somewhere. She
appeared to us yesterday out of the honeysuckle
swamp, and with her usual earnestness exclaimed,
as she pointed her long bony finger at me, 'Little
fool, kiss and cry, kiss and cry, don't I know?
Life is full of 'em; go, love is waiting&mdash;get it;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eyes must weep&mdash;and eyes must hunger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love must sleep and life must wonder;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>don't I know?' And with a loud laugh she
darted into the thick shades and life was left to
'wonder.' There is a good deal of common sense
in her gibberings, and when three years ago she
told me to 'go and make omens' I obeyed, and
came to Mrs. Gaylord, whose hands were full of
cheering 'omens.'"</p>

<p>One week after the northern visit Colonel Hamilton
received very decided orders from headquarters
to return immediately to his regiment. "Lee
must be intercepted."</p>

<p>"You must do it all alone, Lillian," was the
quick remark when the telegram was read.
"Howe &amp; Brother will furnish all in the upholstery
line that will be desired, and be sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
our home is made fitting the reception of our
daughter."</p>

<p>How full the succeeding days were to the hopeful
wife and mother! "She will be here at the
first tinging of the maple trees." This she had
said to her aunt. "Only a little more than two
months in which to make all ready."</p>

<p>"Such a dainty bit of precious girlhood must
not be allowed to step on the common ingrain that
covers your old uncle's floors, I take it." This
was a little improvised indignation as the good
old uncle listened to the plannings and recountings
of the luxuries that were to surround her in
the home to be prepared. "But the fisherman's
cot shouldn't be forgotten, Lillian, and so sometimes
you will let her come to us?"</p>

<p>"What a wicked, naughty uncle you are!" Lillian
exclaimed, while she smothered all further
ebullitions of assumed anger by placing a little
white hand over his mouth. "There! Now to
punish you for those words I shall be at the store
at five for you to go with me and look over the
premises!"</p>

<p>"Want to blacken my fingers with the guilt of
spoiling her do you? Well, well! A full half
hour lost in palavering; good-bye," and the jovial
uncle went out from his home leaving it full of
sunshine.</p>

<p>October dawned bright and beautiful. The hazy
mist that brooded over the city was tinted with
hues of purple and gold as they became tangled
with the many colored leaves that fell through the
cool shadows in the public squares, and in a
week Lily-Pearl Hamilton would arrive! One
cloud only was shadowing the path of Mrs. Hamilton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
and that the absence and dangers of him to
whom her heart had clung through all the gloomy
days; but in a few months his "three years"
would close and then&mdash;how happy they would all
be!</p>

<p>"If Pearl can succeed in getting Old Auntie and
Lizzy safely here, as he assured me he could do,"
she had said, "my cup will be full to overflowing!"</p>

<p>"How will your mother bear all this?" queried
Mrs. Cheevers.</p>

<p>"With no serious result I imagine. The doctor
told me the other day that she was not susceptible
of a very severe shock, her brain having
become so inactive that no injury would probably
come to it through excitement."</p>

<p>Suddenly recollecting that Pearl's mother was
to meet her at the new home at ten she hastened
away.</p>

<p>"Everything was <i>perfect</i> in the new home," was
Mrs. Hamilton's conclusion, as with Lillian she
walked from room to room. "Not massive and
oppressive with a superabundance of heavy carvings
and marble, but bright and cheerful in its
display of luxury and beauty. Your taste is good,
my daughter, and I think Pearl will commend it."</p>

<p>While at the tea-table that night a letter was
brought in for Lillian. "From George," she said,
breaking the seal. "A long one for an invalid
certainly," and she unfolded the well-filled sheet
and began its perusal. Finishing the first page
she laid it upon her lap and folded her hand over
it.</p>

<p>"Well," she said at length; then perceiving
that her uncle and aunt were gazing quizzingly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
her; "wonders are multiplying!" and she recommenced
its perusal.</p>

<p>"Do stop her, wife, and make her tell what it is
that brings such a queer look into her face! If I
were a woman; but pshaw!" The wife laughed.</p>

<p>"In just one moment, Uncle," and Lillian
turned the page. "He is nearly well, and&mdash;yes&mdash;he
will accept my invitation to be here in Christmas
week with his bride!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Another southern aristocrat mixing
up with northern plebeianism I reckon! What's
that quotation, wife? 'To be seen is to be loved?'"</p>

<p>"No, no! You are talking about vice! 'To
be hated needs only to be seen.' But <i>this</i> is a
wife!"</p>

<p>"O, well I never could remember poetry.
George to be married! All right! I will give
him welcome to his miseries! But who is the fair
one?"</p>

<p>"The daughter of the widow with whom they
are staying; one fully worthy to bear the honored
name of St. Clair. So he writes."</p>

<p>"The same old silly story; but I am glad of it!
Let me see&mdash;when is that 'Lily-Pearl' to get
here? I cannot wait much longer!"</p>

<p>"And you will not be obliged to do so. I
shall expect her now on every train, for there was
something in her letter that appeared like surprising.
She said 'a week at the farthest, but I
am so impatient to get close to my mother once
more that I fear I cannot wait much longer for
Mrs. Gaylord to smooth down her ruffles.'"</p>

<p>She did wait, however, but the day came when
the carriage containing the long lost daughter
with her escort and servant stopped before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
door of Mrs. Hamilton's temporary home and
alighted. What a rush of emotion came into the
heart of the young girl when she remembered that
beneath that roof was the one who had been the
cause of all her desolations and roamings! But
they were over now, and with a light tread she
darted up the marble steps and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"By surprise after all," she remarked, turning
to Mrs. Gaylord, who was following. The door
flew open and with an exclamation of joy she
sprang into her mother's embrace.</p>

<p>"The train is not due for five minutes," Lillian
said at last, finding breath to speak. "I was just
coming to the door to watch down the street as I
have done for many days."</p>

<p>But why attempt to picture the scenes of bliss
that followed? All hearts in the broad circle of
love save one opened wide to receive its new accessions.
Mrs. Cheevers could never tire of eulogizing
her pretty ways and simplicity of manners,
while the husband reiterated fully twice each day
that even his pet, Lillian, never came up to her
daughter in good looks or winning ways.</p>

<p>Still Mrs. Belmont utterly refused to see her
grandchild. In vain did Lillian assure her that
the past had been severed forever, and Lily only
waited to tell her this, but her answering wail of
agony was truly pitiful to hear.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no!" she would say, "I cannot, O, I
cannot! Keep her away! Keep her away! O
God! But he will not hear? Don't let her come,
Lillian my child. I did it! So cruel! So
wicked!" With streaming eyes Lillian would pet
and caress her mother with most earnest solicitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>Day after day passed with no better results.
She would not see Lily, neither would she be
taken to the beautiful home on Broad street.
"Let me die here," she would plead, when told of
the pretty room that had been fitted up for her&mdash;so
nearly like the one at Rosedale. But she
shrank at the very recital and settled down in her
easy chair like a weary child who desires to be let
alone.</p>

<p>"What shall I do!" This from Mrs. Hamilton,
one morning coming into the presence of her
daughter, after one more fruitless attempt. "She
will never consent to leave here, and I cannot go
without her. Neither do I like to use compulsion."</p>

<p>"Why not wait for Father? Perhaps he can
persuade her."</p>

<p>"For two months, darling?"</p>

<p>"If no better thing can be done."</p>

<p>The mother smiled. "Perhaps you are correct.
This may be best. I think we will wait."</p>

<h3><a name="AUNT_VINA_IN_THE_NEW_HOME" id="AUNT_VINA_IN_THE_NEW_HOME"></a>AUNT VINA IN THE NEW HOME.</h3>


<p>The weeks succeeding the incidents of our last
chapter sped rapidly by. Winter came with its
chilling winds, rifling the waving branches of
their many colors, leaving them bare and unsightly;
while it spread now and then over the seared
lawns a pure white covering of snow, to hide for
a time its sad work; and upon all this Mrs. Belmont
looked with dreamy listlessness from her
window. What was beauty, death, or change to
her now, shut out as she was from the past, and
in fear of the future? When kind hearts attempted
to gain her consent to have the monotony
of life broken she would plead: "No, no, let me
stay here! It is cold, I cannot go! Lillian, my
child, don't let her come! She will look at me
with her large eyes, so much like my baby's! It
would kill me!"</p>

<p>What was Mrs. Hamilton to do? The elegant
home on Broad street was waiting, and Christmas
week approaching. She could not leave her mother
to be a burden to others, and Lily said, "perhaps
Father can persuade her;" and so they lingered
for his coming.</p>

<p>"Unless some imperative duties shall arise
to prevent I will run home for a Christmas dinner,"
he had written.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>The opening of the holidays came at last, as all
bright places in life come and flit past, and Colonel
Hamilton returned on leave to his home with
buoyant spirits, for he did not come alone. Aunt,
Vina, with her broad, good-natured face, followed
the gaily dressed officer from the carriage, and
close behind her walked Lizzie and little Bobby.
"For Miss Lillian, I'se couldn't leave him," was
the earnest exclamation preceding the greeting.</p>

<p>"No more could you Lizzie, and we could never
have gotten along without little Bobby," and Mrs.
Hamilton caught the diminutive mulatto of ten
in her arms and kissed his plump yellow cheek.</p>

<p>Never was a mother more heartily welcomed by her
child than was 'old Aunt Vina,' by her pet of former
years. "Bress de Lord, honey! I thought dese
old arms wouldn't neber hold my sweet darlin'
no more!" she exclaimed, as tears coursed rapidly
over her cheeks. "But de Missus, honey? Old
Vina's eyes ache to look on her once more; de
poor dear! Massa says she's dreffle bad, but de
Lord knows what's bes'!"</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell me about this?" asked
Lillian of her husband as soon as the dear old
arms had liberated her sufficiently to permit
her to do so. "It would have helped in the
waiting if I had had the opportunity of anticipating
a little?"</p>

<p>"I was not sure of succeeding in my project
myself until three days ago," he answered,
between the repeated caresses he was lavishing on
his beautiful daughter.</p>

<p>"She's just like her mudder," interposed Aunt
Vina; "and dis old heart's got her fast!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let it hold her, Vina, and permit her young
life to draw as much good from its hidden treasures
as my darling wife has received," and Colonel
Hamilton placed the hand of his child in the
old negress's grasp. "Let your motherly love
widen sufficiently to make room for both of my
treasures, will you?"</p>

<p>"Dat I will, and place enough for de missus
too!" Here a hearty laugh all around, in which
Mr. and Mrs. Cheevers joined in merrily.</p>

<p>The day after to-morrow would be Christmas,
and a small party was expected in the new home.
How much there was to be done before that
time! "The first thing of all," said Lillian, emphatically,
"is to get Mother to Broad street! We
have everything in readiness&mdash;a cook and maid of
all work secured."</p>

<p>"And nobody wants 'em," chimed in Lizzie.
"Reckon Vina an' me knows all dat!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and after our little fete is over you two
shall be fully enstalled as advisory committee in
our quiet domain, while Bobby can wait on the
door and learn to be a man. I suppose you know
that you are no longer slaves, and, unless I am
very good to you, some day you may take into
your kind old heads to leave me."</p>

<p>"Neber, Missus!" chimed in two voices at the
same time.</p>

<p>Dinner was now ready for the hungry travelers,
but Mrs. Hamilton could not eat. "I will go to
Mother," she said, "for she will hear the voices
and perhaps recognize them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmont was alone, for Mrs. Jackson had
been dismissed upon the arrival of the daughter
into the household; and Mrs. Gaylord had immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
gone to visit a relative in another part of
the city with a promise to return to them for a few
weeks after all were settled. Lillian opened the
door of the chamber with some trepidation. As
she did so two large eyes were fastened upon her
with a speechless wonder lighting up their slumbering
fires.</p>

<p>"I came to eat dinner with you, Mother," the
daughter said cheerily, coming to her side. "Not
tasted it? I am in good time then. It will spoil
if you allow it to get cold. This chicken pie is
not the way Aunt Vina used to get it up, is it?
But I like it quite as well. Let us try it."</p>

<p>"Has she come?"</p>

<p>"Who, Mother?"</p>

<p>"Vina."</p>

<p>"Yes, and Lizzie, with little Bobby."</p>

<p>"And he?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Charles."</p>

<p>"No, Mother, but he is at Rosedale, well and
hopeful. You know some one is needed there to
take care of the place and servants. But Pearl is
below stairs and will be here to see you after
dinner."</p>

<p>The good things on the small table, however,
remained untouched, for the once proud mistress
of Rosedale was silently watching the curtain,
that had fallen around her world, slowly move
one side, as the panorama of the past came laggardly
to view. Lillian watched the changing
expression on the thin face with interest, unwilling
to interrupt the ebbing emotions she was
sure were casting their flitting shadows upon it.
Not until the sound of feet coming along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
hall, and then halting before the door, was a
word spoken. "Mother; Pearl has come," and,
without permission, Lillian arose and opened the
door.</p>

<p>"Just as I left you;" he exclaimed, cheerfully,
stepping to the side of the invalid's chair.
"Surely you have not been sitting here all the
time?"</p>

<p>She did not move or look at him.</p>

<p>"It is too bad to stay in this one room so long,
and to-day we will have a change. In an hour,
Lillian, there will be a carriage at the door, and
we will take Mother to another room, where she
will not be obliged to look upon the same wall of
brick and stone always."</p>

<p>She started, and her gaze rested on the manly
face so near her own.</p>

<p>"Not a word," he responded, playfully, placing
his hand over her mouth, "I am going to show
you one of the brightest rainbows that has ever
spanned your blue sky of life. All the brighter,
dear Mother, for the dark clouds behind it. You
are looking much better than when I went away;
and that scarlet shawl gives quite a healthy glow
to your cheeks. How happy we shall be! In a
few months my army life will come to an end;
then I will throw up my commission and be one
among you, and let Rosedale go to its rightful
owner,&mdash;we can be happier without it."</p>

<p>"Charles?" said the feeble voice.</p>

<p>"Shall be where his mother can enjoy him. In
an hour, remember, we will go. Wrap warmly,
for it is cold outside;" and, without another word,
Colonel Hamilton left the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Mother, you must eat something, for you
will want strength for your ride."</p>

<p>She obeyed, and, without speaking, did good justice
to the ample meal. The firm will of a strong
controlling mind had conquered, and Mrs. Belmont
submitted to every suggestion without an
opposing gesture.</p>

<p>The servants, immediately after dinner, were
taken to their new quarters, with Lily as their
mistress, and then the Colonel returned in the
carriage for his wife and mother. He found her
warmly cloaked and shawled, but every nerve
trembled as one shivering with ague. Not apparently
noticing it, he said, merrily, "How the boys
in blue would envy me," and he placed his arm
around the shrinking form to aid the timid feet
down the long flight of stairs. "To be a lady's
gallant is a luxury not often indulged in by us
poor soldiers. The air is delicious out of doors;
it will give you new life and strength. There
now, you are all right, safe on terra firma!" And
slowly he led her on.</p>

<p>Mechanically she moved through the hall to the
outer door, down the marble steps, and was lifted
into the carriage with many a lively sally from
Lillian, who followed full of wonder. As carefully
was she assisted out again on arriving at her
destination; and entering the splendid drawing-room
looked wildly about her.</p>

<p>"Right here, Mother, in this easy chair;" and
her tender escort seated her near the register.</p>

<p>"Jus' you let me do dis;" calmly said Vina,
coming up to her once stately mistress, and she
began removing her wrappings. "Dar's no use
ob dese old hands forgettin' how. And Missus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
I'se mighty glad de good Lord sent 'way down to
Georgy after this ere gal, 'cause He knowed dar
was no one like old Vina could do for de missus."</p>

<p>All the time the faithful hands were at work,
while the brightening eyes of the invalid were
scanning the kindly face of the old slave.</p>

<p>When all wraps were removed and passed to
Lizzy to take from the room, she took her thin
white hand in her dusky palm, and, kneeling by
the chair, said plaintively; "Bress de Lord! Let
ebery body bress Him, for He is good! O Missus!
Vina's heart is big, 'cause it's so glad! Bress de
Lord!"</p>

<p>The other white hand was lifted slowly and
placed on the bowed head of the negress as the
pale lips muttered, "Bless the Lord! Pray, pray!"</p>

<p>"Glory!" and the old servant sprang to her
feet.</p>

<p>"De angels will clap dar hands wid joy! Missus
is goin' to de mansions by-and-by!"</p>

<p>A quiet glow of peace stole into the restless
eyes, as Mrs. Belmont listened, and settling down
in her easy chair, she really looked like the picture
of contentment, as the Colonel asserted, entering
as Vina went out.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Cheevers were to take a quiet tea
with them, and, as the uncle declared, "would
bring along the horse-shoe, as there would be no
good luck without it." And soon all were seated
in the drawing-room in pleasant conversation, to
which Mrs. Belmont apparently gave no heed.
An hour passed, when the careful mistress, who
was, indeed, troubled about many things, took the
arm of her husband and went into the parlor
opposite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is so tranquil; how can we disturb her?"
was the first ejaculation.</p>

<p>"We will not disturb her my dear."</p>

<p>"But what about Lily?"</p>

<p>"What about her? Why she's the sweetest
darling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no! How shall we bring them together?"</p>

<p>"In the most natural way possible. When tea
is ready I will escort her out to the table and introduce
our daughter. She is a child and will submit
to be governed and led. But where is Lily?
I have not seen her for a long time."</p>

<p>"Gone to her room with a letter from Willie, I
imagine, as her cheeks put on an unusual glow
when a small package was placed in her hand
by the carrier."</p>

<p>"What makes you say that, Lillian? Do you
suppose that the heart of our child is in any way
entangled with that boy's love?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>The subject of this conversation came tripping
down the broad staircase, and with a buoyant step
entered the room where her father and mother
were standing by the window.</p>

<p>"See what Willie has sent me for Christmas!"
she exclaimed, holding up a finger adorned by a
ring set with precious stones.</p>

<p>"An engagement ring my darling?"</p>

<p>"O no! We never thought of such a thing.
He is my brother, that is all!" The sweet face
could but crimson as she looked into that of her
father.</p>

<p>"I believe you, darling; and as a brother he
will be loved by us all."</p>

<p>"Is it not beautiful?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>"It has cost him many a day of hard work,
without doubt," was the reply, while the mother
was carefully examining the costly gift. "Poor
Willie! He writes that he is not very well."</p>

<p>"He misses his companion of so many years,
and the bestowing of this gift has brightened up
his loneliness more than anything else could have
done." This from the mother thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The bell announcing tea was heard in the hall,
and the colonel, bidding his daughter see that all
was ready, went to the drawing-room for the invalid.
It was as he had said. Placing his arm
tenderly about her shrinking form he led her into
the dining-room where she met her granddaughter
with only a slight quivering of the hand that was
clinging so closely to the arm supporting her.</p>

<p>Lily kissed the pale cheek as she said: "I will
take her to the seat where Aunt Vina says she
must sit." During this the peaceful glow did not
fade from her eyes, or the expression of resignation
from her face.</p>

<p>"You are a magician as well as a prophet,"
whispered Lillian, returning to the head of the
table.</p>

<p>They were happy now. The rainbow was
spanning the dark clouds, and its cheering colors
were reflected in every face.</p>

<p>"Charles," feebly whispered Mrs. Belmont.</p>

<p>"Yes, and Mrs. Gaylord, who ought also to be
here," remarked the colonel, "for I have good
news of her husband. He will be liberated and
sent north in a very short time." How bright the
sky can be after the clouds are driven out of it!</p>

<h3><a name="GOOD_BYE" id="GOOD_BYE"></a>"GOOD BYE."</h3>


<p>Gentle reader, would you like to follow the
friends whom you have met in this simple narrative
still farther in the histories of their eventful
lives? Has your acquaintance thus far been a
pleasant one? This is not all. Every thoughtful
mind will draw from the characters of history
or romance such lessons of hope and faith as cheer
the heart in sorrow or beneath the depressions of
despondency something that will guide when the
soul is perplexed or shrinking. Sad indeed would
the writer of this story be, if in the delineations of
the history of our little heroine no lonely wayfarer
should be comforted, or no friendless waif taught
to look up for the hand that safely leads. God is
kind and watchful towards his children, assuring
them that they are "better than many sparrows,"
and therefore cannot fall to the ground without
his notice; but is also just to punish and chasten
those who oppose his little ones.</p>

<p>Have these truths been set impressively before
you? If so we will raise the curtain yet a little
higher and glance for one moment into the lives
and homes of the few in whom you are interested,
after the terrible war is over and peace again settles
down like a holy benediction over our beautiful
land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Hamilton could not be spared from the
important position he had occupied from the commencement
of the struggle, and although his
visits home were frequent, the elegant house on
Broad street wore an air of desolation as the
shadows of realities and uncertainties crept into it.
The reports of victories and defeats brought terror
and dismay into every heart, for loved ones were
in jeopardy and mourning was in the land.</p>

<p>One day there came a letter from the absent
husband that thickened the veil of apprehension
and spread a new gloom over the hearts of those
who read it. "We must expect bad news my dear
wife," it went on to say; "and although I would
shield my cherished ones from war's disasters I
cannot do it. Reports were brought in last night
by our scouts that Rosedale was in ashes and your
brother, in a desperate hand to hand encounter
with some of the boys in blue, received a wound
from which he died before reaching the hospital
camp. I was hoping to be able to shield him, and
for our mother's sake send him north. But now
he is beyond our reach."</p>

<p>"My poor, poor brother!" cried Mrs. Hamilton,
as the letter dropped from her hands. "I had
placed so much hope on his coming! What can
I tell Mother? She is so much better, and was
asking only this morning when Charles would be
here?"</p>

<p>"We cannot break the new sad news to her,"
replied the daughter; "let us wait for Father.
Somehow he is able to do everything without
difficulty."</p>

<p>Lillian smiled in spite of her tears. "Yes,
darling, we will wait." But it could not be. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
hungry heart of the mother was enduring the
agony of famishing, and her cries for her only son
were truly pitiful.</p>

<p>"Let the consequences be what they may I cannot
longer endure her appeals; she must know the
truth," she said to Lily one morning some weeks
after. "Mother&mdash;Pearl cannot send him to you&mdash;how
gladly he would do it if he could; but it is too
late!"</p>

<p>"Too late?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother; the war you know. It has destroyed
Rosedale, scattered the servants and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Charles?"</p>

<p>"Charles has fallen into the ruin."</p>

<p>"Charles? Will he not come?"</p>

<p>"Never Mother; he is dead! And we are
alone!"</p>

<p>"Dead! Dead! And he will not come! Gone!
All, all gone!" and the white fingers linked themselves
together, twisting and untwisting with a
slow nervous motion as they lay upon her lap,
while her large eyes never moved their gaze from
the face before her.</p>

<p>"Dead! Dead!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Pearl will be here by and by, and he will love
you and be as true a son as my brother would
have been. Let us wait and watch for him now."</p>

<p>"Dead! Dead! My boy&mdash;my Charles!" From
this one subject nothing could divert her thoughts.
The sad, mournful wail bubbled up from her
stricken heart as naturally as her breath issued
from her lungs, moaning and breathing; yet not a
tear moistened the burning eyeballs, until one
morning while Vina was arranging her dress for
the day and telling her how "de poor heart broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
when little Shady went out and neber more come
back," the unseen hand laid a finger upon the
main-spring of human life and it stopped. Mrs.
Belmont, the ambitious mistress of Rosedale was
also dead! The flickering light of a once massive
brain was blown out; the prison door opened, and
the pent-up soul was gone! Now indeed were the
shadows deepened! The emblems of mourning
were upon the door and reflected their sombre
shade's over everything within.</p>

<p>Colonel Hamilton could not leave his regiment,
as they were engaged in active duty; and so the
daughter laid her away in Woodland cemetery
under the cool shadows, as the setting sun was
scattering its last rays upon the sparkling waters
at the base of the hill. As the birds were chanting
their good-night songs the solemn cortege
turned away&mdash;back to life with all of its coming
and stirring events, yet with heavy hearts.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, we will leave Aunt Vina sole
mistress of all and go to Kirkham for a few weeks
at least," Mrs. Hamilton said a few mornings
after, in answer to her daughter's plea.</p>

<p>"Willie is so anxious to tell me something and
ask me about it. It has been a whole year since
my visit, and two since our separation, he writes.
I am so glad you have consented."</p>

<p>Few preparations were needed, and in a week
Willie and "Phebe" were once more sitting
together in the little parlor, where as a diminutive
waif she had entered more than twelve years before,
alone and unattended. What power of
prescience could have pictured the changes? What
vicissitudes and pleasures; what a mixing up of
joys and sorrows, of snarls and hair-breadth escapes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
there had been crowded into the rolling
years.</p>

<p>"I guess I may better read the letter, for I can
never tell you what is in it," said Willie, taking
the well-worn missive from his pocket. "No, you
may have that pleasure, while I will watch your
face, reading as well as you."</p>

<p>"How you puzzle me, Willie. I have a good
mind to run away alone to read it; you have made
me nervous!"</p>

<p>"Not a step shall you go." But her quick eyes
were following the page down at a rapid rate, and
did not listen.</p>

<p>"O Willie!" she exclaimed as she turned the
paper and went on. "Do you believe it? Can it
be true?"</p>

<p>"He says so!"</p>

<p>"And he knows. 'I have written Mr. Palmer,'
he says, 'and am informed that there will be no
difficulty in the operation, but it will require considerable
practice on your part to be able to walk
firmly as he does.' I know that he has two cork
feet or legs, as one day while behind him on
Chestnut street a friend pointed him out with the
expression, 'who would imagine that his walkers
were artificial?' But those poor little feet! O
Willie, there is no joy without its gloomy side!"</p>

<p>But Willie did walk; never without his cane,
but his creeping days came to an end, and a
thankful heart blessed God for its unexpected
bliss. Social life now has no horrors for his sensitive
nature, and he mingled freely with the
refined and intelligent who frequented the parlors
of the honored colonel and his lovely family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>Reader, are you curious to see him? If so look
for him in one of the largest clothing stores in the
city of Philadelphia. Not as clerk or seamster as
in former days, but as half owner and proprietor.
Be good, pure and noble if you would succeed in
reaching the eminence ambition points out to you.
"Carve out your niche and place yourself in it,"

<p>The war came to a close at last, and Mr. St.
Clair with his wife and daughter returned to their
southern home. Mrs. Mason received them joyfully,
but declared that she could "never, <i>never</i>
forgive George for his silly freak of connecting
himself with such plebeianism! My daughter's
governess! He may better remain where such
follies are tolerated!" But the parents only
laughed, and the sister remained silent.</p>

<p>Rosedale would be rebuilt, not in as magnificent
style as before, for its owner's long stay in the
north had taught him many lessons.</p>

<p>"It may be I shall not care to occupy it," the
son had remarked at the parting; "but my sweet
sister will make a noble mistress for it."</p>

<p>And so it proved. George St. Clair became a
northern man in deed as well as in feelings. He
proved a successful tradesman and government
officer in New York city in company with Elmore
Pierson, who had been spared to his mother.</p>

<p>A happy family gathered in the home circle,
blessed with fresh young blossoms of human life
who were to adorn the world and bring comfort
into the declining years of those whose feet were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
going downward. It is but a short journey between
the two great rival cities, and the friends
bound together by so many vicissitudes kept up a
pleasant intimacy, often reviving past memories
by tales of pleasant scenes or strange coincidences
that would otherwise fade from sight in the moving
panorama of human existence.</p>

<p>"We will have that Christmas dinner we were
to have had three years ago," exclaimed Colonel
Hamilton a week before the world-famed day. "A
regular house warming! Let me see! Can we
not get Willie's sister here with her family, and
not let the dear boy know anything about it until
then? Gaylord and his wife have gone back to
their home, and I suppose he would not come with
any amount of coaxing! He has grown so sour
and ugly during the last six years that I pity
that feeble little wife of his! O my letter! I
have not even told you what has set me in such a
commotion! Just like one of my freaks of forgetfulness!"</p>

<p>"I was wondering," laughed Mrs. Hamilton, for
he was skipping around the room with the joyousness
of a little boy, while searching in his pockets
for the letter that was to make the revelations.</p>

<p>"Where is the thing? Well I declare, if it is
not down to the office on the desk, as true as the
world! If Willie gets hold of it! But no matter."</p>

<p>"Do, tell me, Pearl! I am glad you have doffed
your regimentals. How you would look in a Colonel's
uniform at this moment!"</p>

<p>"Honor and glory must pass away, but the St.
Clair's will not pass away; they are coming and
may be here to-day, Mrs. Mason and all!"</p>

<p>"And remain till after the holidays?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>"Longer, my dear! Christmas dinner, however,
is the main subject under consideration. Let me
see; Vina is getting pretty old for such an occasion,
and if she will keep little Charlie safe in the
nursery, it is about all we ought to ask of her.
Lizzie is good in her place, and little Bobby is
a treasure; but we must have another cook. What
makes you look so solemn, my dear wife?"</p>

<p>"O, no&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;only what?"</p>

<p>"Is that Major Belknap to be here?"</p>

<p>"Do you not like him, Lillian? He was one
of the bravest and noblest officers in the whole
regiment."</p>

<p>"It is not that. But how can I ever spare my
darling child?"</p>

<p>"This will have to be done some day; and I
know of no one to whom I could more easily
transfer our daughter's happiness. It is evident
that her heart is not wholly her own, and it
would not look well: for you or me to interfere
with any arrangement of this kind," he laughed.
The sunshine of the husband's cheerfulness fell
into the chilly places of the mother's fears, warming
them into brightness.</p>

<p>The Christmas festivities were a secured success.</p>

<p>George St. Clair came down from New York,
to be clasped in the arms of his devoted mother;
and receive the hearty hug from the dear old
father, and loving embrace from one sister, and
the cold salutations of the second. "If this does
not take away my breath," he exclaimed, drawing
his hesitating wife towards the stately Mrs.
Mason, while disengaging herself from the demonstrative
greetings of others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sister," he said, "this is my wife, who has
generously consented to add an additional lustre
to the St. Clair escutcheon, and, without doubt,
would as kindly place you on her list of friends!"</p>

<p>Anna extended her hand, which Mrs. Mason
took with a stiff bow of recognition.</p>

<p>This did not escape the quick eye of Colonel
Hamilton. "A trifle freezy for so warm a room,"
he whispered, sotto voce, as he turned to meet
Willie, who was approaching, leaning on the arm
of his foster-sister.</p>

<p>"This way, my boy. A Merry Christmas,"
and he opened the door into the family sitting-room,
where Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins, with their
own small Willie, were waiting his coming.</p>

<p>He drew back. "Am I dreaming! Fanny,
my sister! Is this really you?" A tear found
its way to the calm blue eyes, whose fountain
had been closed for many a happy month by the
blessings that had been piled upon it.</p>

<p>"We are all here, my brother! You would not
come to us, so we came to you! If Mother could
see&mdash;and know!"</p>

<p>Her voice choked and she turned to the window.</p>

<p>What a happy circle gathered around that
bountifully-loaded table on that Christmas day!
Fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, friends
and lovers! While the host stood with uplifted
hands, asking the Lord to bless and draw all hearts
together, an "Amen" found its way out of every
answering soul; and the feast went on.</p>

<p>Here we leave them, gentle reader,&mdash;bid them
all good bye, with a wish and a prayer for their
future happiness and success.</p>

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
